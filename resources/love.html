<td>The most powerful warrior in battle is one who loves much. To lay down your life for your friends is a sign of a warrior, but even more than this, it's the sign of a lover. Anything we do to help other people will not be effective
if we are not lovers first.</td>

<td><strong>God is a Jealous God</strong></td>
<td>We belong to Christ because we've been bought by the blood of Christ. Since we belong to Christ, He is passionately committed to us. So when the world is trying to direct our hearts away from God, He will intervene out of His jealousy. God's
jealousy is therefore to our benefit since it's our protection.</td>

be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God." <em>Ephesians 3:16-19</em></td>
