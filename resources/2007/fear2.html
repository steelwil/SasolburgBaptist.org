<td><strong>The Antidote</strong></td>
<td>"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." <em>1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</em></td>
<td>From this Scripture we see that love is the antidote to fear. When we have love, we don't need to fear what's going to happen in our lives. This does not mean that bad things won't happen to us. Bad things will happen, but we can have the
assurance that God will get us through it because of His love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>One Solution for All Problems</strong></td>
<td class="even">"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" <em>1 John 4:20</em></td>
<td class="even">When we have difficulty in loving our brothers, all we need to do is to be more intimate with God. We therefore have only one thing to work on: our love for God. Once we grow in love for God, our love for our brothers will follow as a consequence of
loving Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Conquering Death</strong></td>
<td>"And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world." <em>1 John 4:14</em></td>
<td>The only way to receive eternal life is through Jesus Christ. He was sent to the earth to save us. This is why we don't have to fear death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Together Forever</strong></td>
<td class="even">"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?" <em>Romans&nbsp;8:35</em></td>
<td class="even">Not even death can separate us from God once we are children of God. This is the perfection of God's love that we are with Him for all time evermore.</td>
