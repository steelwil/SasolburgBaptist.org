<td>"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The
just shall live by faith." <em>Romans 1:16-17</em></td>

<p>For many of us it is far easier to believe that God will to something for us in the distant future than believing that He can do something for us in the present. It is easier to believe that God is going to provide for us one day when we retire, than
it is for us to believe in the provision for today.</p>
<p>However, God is calling of those who has been declared as righteous to live by faith on a daily basis. Every day there is an opportunity to live by faith.</p></td>

<td><strong>Law vs. Grace</strong></td>
<td class="even">"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is
preferred before me: for he was before me. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." <em>John 1:14-17</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>There is something about the life of Christ and the ministry of Christ that demonstrates the grace of God.</p>
<p>The very nature of the law deals primarily with works. The law deals with our behaviour, our conduct, our deeds.</p>

<p><strong>Grace by Faith</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." <em>Romans 4:4-5</em></td>
<td>In the workplace, we only get promoted when we life up to a certain work ethic. This is totally the opposite of grace. Grace is a total free gift from God.</td>

<p><strong>Also for the Present</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." <em>Hebrews 4:16</em></td>
<td class="even">This Scripture does not refer to some future action, but refers to the present. It therefore highlights our need to have faith in the "now" situation in order to appropriate grace for that "now" moment.</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Faith Strengthen in Difficulty</strong></p>
</td>
<td>Our faith is tested when things are falling apart in our lives. During these moments we go to the throne and receive by faith the grace of God and receive our victory. Many times there's no one else around during such moments and we find that it's
just us and God. Faith therefore thrives during challenging times since receiving the victory strengthens our faith.</td>
<td>"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." <em>Hebrews 12:2</em></td>
