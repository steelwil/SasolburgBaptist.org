<h3>The Church Declaration</h3>
<h4>The Church Believes</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments in their original writings as fully and verbally inspired of God, and accepts
them as final authority for faith and life. (2 Tim 3:16)</li>
<li>In one God, eternally existing in three Persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (Isa 9:6; 1 John 5:7; Matt 28:19; Zacc 13:7; 2
Cor 3:4; 2 Cor 3:17)</li>
<li>That Jesus Christ was begotten of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, and is true God and true Man. (Luke 1:35)</li>
<li>In the personality of the Holy Spirit, His regenerating work, and abiding presence in the true believer. (John 15:26; Titus
2:5; Rom 3:11)</li>
<li>That God created man in His own Image, that man sinned, and therefore incurred the penalty of death, physical, spiritual and
eternal, that all human beings inherit a sinful nature, which issues in actual transgressions involving personal guilt. (Gen
1:26,27; Gen 2:17; Gen 3:6,19; Rom 5:12; Eph 2:1)</li>
<li>That the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins, and substitutionary sacrifice, according to the Scriptures, and that all who
believe in Him are justified on the sole ground of His atoning work. (1 Cor 15:3,4; Eph 2:18; Rom 5:1)</li>
<li>In the bodily Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Ascension into Heaven, and His present Life as our High Priest and
Advocate before God the Father. (John 20:21; Acts 19; 1 Tim 2:5; 1 John 2:1; Hebrews 7:25-27)</li>
<li>In the personal, visible and bodily return of our Lord Jesus Christ to Earth. (Acts 1:11; John 14:3)</li>
<li>That all who receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become children of God (Eph
2:8,9; John 1:12,13)</li>
<li>That sanctification results in personal and practical holiness and is essential to a true and fruitful Christian life and
service. (1 Thess 4:5; 1 Pet 2:1-9; 1 Pet 1:15,16; 2 Cor 7:1; 2 Cor 6:16; 1 John 1 &amp; 2)</li>
<li>in the Resurrection of the just and the unjust, the eternal blessedness of the redeemed and the eternal banishment and
punishment of these who have rejected the offer of Salvation through Christ. (Mark 9:43,44; John 3:18; John 5:28,29; Matt
25:34,41)</li>
<li>That the one true Church is the whole company of these who have been redeemed by Jesus Christ and regenerated by the Holy
Spirit, that the local Church on earth should take its character from this conception of the Church spiritual, and therefore, that
the New Birth and personal confessions of Christ are essentials of Church Membership. (Eph 4:4-6; Rom 12:5)</li>
<li>That Jesus Christ is the Supreme Head of the Church and His Authority is binding upon all Christians.</li>
<li>In the priesthood of all believers. (Eph 4:7-13; Rev 5:10; 1 Pet 2:9)</li>
<li>That the Lord Jesus Christ appointed two ordinances - <em>Baptism</em> and the <em>Lord's Supper</em> - to be observed as acts of obedience, and
as perpetual witnesses to the cardinal facts of the Christian faith, that Baptism is the total immersion of the Believer in water
as a confession of identification with Christ in Burial and Resurrection, and that the Lord's Supper is the partaking of the Bread
and the Cup as symbolical of the Saviour's broken Body and shed Blood, in Remembrance of His sacrificial Death, till He come, that
salvation is not depended on the observance of the ordinances. (Rom 6: Mark 16:16; Luke 22:14-29)</li>
