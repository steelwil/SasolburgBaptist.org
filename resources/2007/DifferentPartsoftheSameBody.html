<h4>Power in Working Together</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">

<tr><td><strong>Different Gifts with a Common Goal</strong></td>
<td>Christ is like a single body, which has many parts; it is still one body, even though it is made up of different parts. In the same way, all of us, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free, have been baptized into the one body by the same Spirit, and we have all been given the one Spirit to drink. <em>1 Corinthians 12:12-13</em></td>
<td>We all have different gifts and the ultimate power in these gifts lies in the combined working together of these gifts. We therefore need to work together to defeat our common enemy.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>You Can't Do This by Yourself</strong></td>
<td>But now I said to them, "See what trouble we are in because Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates are destroyed! Let's rebuild the city walls and put an end to our disgrace." <em>Nehemiah 2:17</em></td>
<td>Here we see how Nehemiah rallied his countrymen to rebuild the city of Jerusalem. In Nehemiah chapter three we see the people achieved the impossible. The only way we can ever accomplish something big and seemingly insurmountable is if we work together.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>His Ploy to Keep the Ministry Weak</strong></td>
<td>When Sanballat heard that we Jews had begun rebuilding the wall, he became furious and began to ridicule us. In front of his companions and the Samaritan troops he said, "What do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Do they intend to rebuild the city? Do they think that by offering sacrifices they can finish the work in one day? Can they make building stones out of heaps of burnt rubble?" <em>Nehemiah 4:1-2</em></td>
<td>Sanballat did not want the city of Jerusalem to be rebuilt because it would take away the power and importance that some of their cities had. Similarly, it's against Satan's plans when we work together and he would do anything in his power to prevent us from working together. He will fool us into thinking that we're doing a great job on our own. We therefore need to be wary, when we find we are doing God's work, by ourselves.</td></tr>
