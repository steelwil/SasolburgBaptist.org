<h3>Covenant - 3</h3>
<img src="../images/audio.jpg" alt="speaker" /><a href="../audio/Covenant%203.mp3">(download sermon)</a>
<h4>A binding agreement made by two or more parties. God's commitment to, and the requirements of&nbsp;His people expressed in promise, law, judgement, faithfulness and mercy.</h4>

<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">God's Commitment and Our Unbelief</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God is Committed</strong></td>
<td>
<p>I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered. Once for all, I have sworn&nbsp;by my holiness - and I will not lie to David. <em>Psalm 89:34-35</em></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Because of God's purity, His word to us is true. The nature of a covenant says that God is fully committed. It's binding!</p>
We see this throughout the Bible. God made a promise with Isreal spelling out the conditions. If they obey Him they will be blessed, but if they disobey Him they will be cursed. We see this promise playing out in the history of Israel. God is committed to
His promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Backed By His Name</strong></td>
<td class="even">I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word. <em>Psalm 138:2</em></td>
<td class="even">When God has made a promise, it is backed by His name. There is no higher name to back a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God Can't Lie</strong></td>
<td>God is not a man that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should chnage his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? <em>Numbers 23: 19</em></td>
<td>Do we really believe that God is able to back his word with his action? Sometimes we have a lot of unbelief in our hearts. Yet, every promise that God made, became a reality through Jesus Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Actions Reflect Our Belief</strong></td>
<td class="even">Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about you body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or
reap or store away in barnes, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <em>Matthew 6:25-27</em></td>
<td class="even">Why are we worrying if we believe that we are more valuable than the birds? We are worrying because we don't believe it. We worry because of unbelief in our hearts. Our worrying and our actions reflect or belief. God has made a covenant, He is
committed, and yet we're&nbsp;stressed out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>The Power of Belief</strong></p>
</td>
<td>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will&nbsp;be loosed in heaven. <em>Matthew 16:19</em></td>
<td>All things are possible through the covenant of Jesus Christ. All it takes is for us to believe. God's word will not fail. God can work mightily when you persist in believing Him in spite of discouragement from the human standpoint.</td>
