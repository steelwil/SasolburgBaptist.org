<h3>Get God's Vision / Heart</h3>
<p>"When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven". Neh
1:4</p>

<h3>Starting Point</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ. We start at the finished work of Christ's death and resurrection.</p>
<p>In the past (old covenant) God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these
last days (new covenant) He has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things... Heb 1:1-2 (NIV)</p>
<p>Jesus says, "the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and he leads them out." John 10:3 (NIV)</p>

</ul>

<h3>Heart of God for every family</h3>
<p>"For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died... All this is from God,
who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to
himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them..." 2 Cor 5:14-19 (NIV)</p>

<h3>Closed the door to the enemy</h3>
<p>"You have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historical right". Neh 2:20b</p>
