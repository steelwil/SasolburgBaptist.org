</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Getting Distracted</strong></td>
<td>"As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked with them, but they were kept from recognizing him." <em>Luke 24:15</em></td>
<td>This is so much like us. We are so busy with the problems of life that Jesus himself is dwelling by us with his Spirit and we don't find him and miss out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Can Others See The Difference</strong></td>
<td class="even">If we were to do an experiment with a believer and a non-believer by observing them in the same situation, would there be any difference in how they behave? Very often there isn't really a significant difference and as Christians we sometimes find
ourselves saying "I see how Jesus lived, but it's just not a reality in my life."</td>
<td class="even">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Finished Work of Christ</strong></td>
<td>"He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work." <em>1 John 3:8</em></td>
<td>Part of the devil's work is to keep us so busy that we do not find Jesus in our day-to-day living. But Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, therefore we need to get back to the finished work of the cross.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Finding Christ in Every Situation</strong></td>
<td class="even">Paul found Christ in every situation. The only way we can ever be content is if we find Jesus in every situation.</td>
<td class="even">"I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances." <em>Philippians 4:11</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Patience is Key</strong></td>
<td>When you look for Jesus in the situation, you need to be focused and persevere.</td>
<td>"As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy." <em>James 5:11</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>It's About Faith</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">It's not easy to seek Christ in your situation when your mind is at war. It's not just going to happen, but is an issue of faith.</td>
<td class="even">"Ask and it will be giving to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." <em>Matthew 7:7</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Building Your Faith</strong></td>
<td>"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things." <em>Colossians 3:1-2</em></td>
<td>The very moment we take the time to set our hearts and minds on things above we are drawing near to Christ and He is drawing near to us.</td>
