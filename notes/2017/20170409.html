<p>Notes (More or less) by Dr Gary Whetstone</p>

<h3>Revelation knowledge</h3>

<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> a new way of seeing</p>
<p><strong>Experience:</strong> results from God's action</p>

<p>You will not have the experience part until the Word of God is revealed personally to you.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation knowledge:</strong> to reveal, unveil, or disclose by direct encounter of the Holy Spirit; He takes things never seen by natural senses and discloses it to you.

<ul>
<li>It is not received by normal senses or by logical progression of thoughts.</li>
<li>Your senses, or mind will never tell you you are righteous.</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is unveiling to your spirit what Jesus did for you</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to receive revelation knowledge</h3>
<p>"No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.
None of the rulers of this age understood it...but God has revealed it to us by His Spirit." 1 Cor 2:7-10 (NIV)</p>

<p><strong>Mystery / secret wisdom:</strong> information disclosed by God</p>

<h4>a. God alone gives revelation by His Holy Spirit</h4>

<p>"We have not received the spirit of world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given
us." 1 Cor 2:12 (NIV)</p>

<h4>b. God requires an open heart of expectation.</h4>
<p><strong>Set yourself, and focus on the Lord until you are made to understand.</strong></p>

<p>"Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding And to humble yourself before your God..." Dan 10:12 (NIV)</p>

<p><strong>Cry out with your heart!</strong></p>

<p>"I call with all my heart; answer me, O Lord and I will obey your decrees." Psalm 119:145 (NIV)</p>

<h4>c. You must meditate.</h4>
<p><strong>Meditate:</strong> to mutter, speak, roll over and over again</p>

<p>"But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he Meditates day and night." Psalm 1:2 (NIV)</p>

<p>The biblical process to manifest His word--meditation, revelation, motivation, action, fruit of God's Word.</p>

<p><strong>Meditation produces Revelation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Revelation produces Motivation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motivation produces Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>Action produces Fruits or Results</strong></p>

<h3>REVELATION HAS PENETRATION AND GOVERNING POWER</h3>

<p>Revelation is not just words--it comes with an intensity that inscribes His Word on your heart and mind.</p>

<p>"This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will
write them on their minds." Heb 10:16 (NIV)</p>

<h4>Example of violating laws:</h4>
<p>When you get close to the event of violation, you become very aware of the penalty of those laws. Law-impressed becomes guardian
to your lifestyle--if making an off-course decision, the law then comes up and alarms you on the inside.</p>

<p>Likewise, the revelation of righteousness will become a guardian of your lifestyle. When you violate the laws of liberty
in Christ Jesus, then righteousness revelation comes up and governs your thinking</p>
