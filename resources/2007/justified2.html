<p>"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto
him for righteousness." <em>Romans 4:1-4</em></p>

<p><strong>Forget the Past</strong></p>

<td>Being justified by God means that we have been acquitted and vindicated of everything in our past. If we truly repent of our sins then anyone who judges us because of our past, is in reality not judging us but Christ.</td>

<td class="even">Without the resurrection there is no justification. It's therefore difficult to separate the teaching on justification from the teaching on the resurrection since they go hand in hand. We are only justified if we believe that Christ was raised from
the dead for our sins. This is one of the principles of Christianity.</td>
