<h4>Living Loved By God</h4>

<p>1.Our faith in Jesus transfers God's righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes. This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us. 2.Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvellous kindness that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God's glory! 3.But that's not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures will develop in us patient endurance. 4.And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope. 5.And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy, <b>because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!</b> Rom 5:1-5 TPT</p>

<p>14 For this reason I kneel before the <u>Father</u>, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his <u>Spirit</u> in your inner being, so that <u>Christ</u> may <b>dwell in your hearts</b> through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be <u>filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</u> 20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen. Eph 3:14-21 NIV</p>

<p>God does not require worship or adoration because He has a need but because for mankind it is directed away from self and is an expression of what love is, being the first steps to living outside of self.</p>

<p>The pathway of self always focuses on I but the true pathway of life always focuses on love which is always directed towards relationship and therefore others. True love never demands of others but gives others the opportunity to give to the others in relationship.<p>

<p>Love always seeks to bless empower promote others never itself. It was inevitable because God is love in essence that God would create those to be in His image who would love loved and love living because living is giving and God loves to give to bless to prosper.</p>

<p>Seeking first the kingdom and righteousness is love expressed because self is not the focus. All worry and anxiety is rooted in fear and fear is focused on self.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of God is where love is expressed it is founded upon love its essence is love.</p>

<p>The whole kingdom is focused on others loving others righteousness peace and joy justice is where others can be blessed and is foundational.</p>

<h4>Open the gate of first love</h4>
<p>This gate is often most damaged by our natural experiences of hurt, pain and rejection. Renouncing inner vows, repenting of fear and forgiving hurts, we invite Him into our spirit and out through our soul and body by deliberately opening the door. Jesus is knocking: the door handle is on our side and it is up to us to open it (Rev 3:20). We give God first love, first place, first priority (Mike Parsons)</p>
