<td class="even">
<p>The condition of the church today in general is not as should be as described in this text. We see Jesus taking blows because of the lifestyle of the church.</p>
<p>God has raised Christ above all things for the benefit of the church. This is why the church has a very important role to release the fullness of Christ to the community.</p>

<td><strong>Raised Up Together</strong></td>
<td>"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." <em>Ephesians&nbsp;2:6</em></td>
<td>This is where Jesus wants the church to be.</td>

mine, and shall shew it unto you." <em>John 16:13-14</em></td>
<td>Here we can see that the Holy Spirit is manifesting Christ. The spiritual gifts are therefore a revelation of Christ. It's the revelation of His work, His nature, His character. The gifts are thus part of God's glory to be made known to mankind.</td>
