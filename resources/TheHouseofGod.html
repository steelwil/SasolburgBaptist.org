<h4>Where Does God Live?</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>The Ark of the Covenant</strong></td>
<td>The ark of the covenant represented the presence of God on earth in the old testament (Exodus 25).</td>
<td>And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. <em>Exodus 25:22</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Much Too Big</strong></td>
<td>However, God was too big to fit into a little box. The work of His hands it testimony that He is far greater than our minds are able to conceive.</td>
<td><p>"When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;" <em>Psalms 8:3</em></p>
<p>"He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by <em>their</em> names." <em>Psalms 147:4</em></p></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>The Biggest Temple in the World Not Big Enough</strong></td>
<td><p>It was David's vision to build a magnificent temple for the ark of the Lord, but David's son, Solomon, was the one who eventually built the temple. However, God was too big to dwell in a building made by human hands. Solomon's temple was destroyed by king Nebuchadnezzar in 597BC. </p>
</td><td>"And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name." <em>1 Kings 5:5</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Where Does God Live Today?</strong></td>
<td>One place where God is living is in heaven.</td>
<td>"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, <em>a voice</em> as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter. Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;" <em>Revelations 4:1-2</em>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>And Where Else</strong></td>
<td>However, if we know Jesus Christ as our saviour then God is also living in us. This is why God loves us more than anything else because we had to be the most precious temple for Him to dwell in us. We are considered of more worth than Solomon's temple.</td>
<td>"Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and <em>that</em> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" <em>1 Corinthians 3:16</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>A Worthy Temple</strong></td>
<td>Our lives should reflect the presence of God in us.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
