<h3>It's time to build</h3>
<h3>Love Builds Up</h3>
<p>Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up,
<u>
<b>but love builds up.</b>
</u> 1 Cor 8:1 (NIV)</p>

<p>During November 2017 God spoke to me and said, "It is now the time to start building from our new nature in Christ."</p>

<h3>Building with God</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labour in vain. Ps 127:1 (NIV)</li>
<li>Jesus replied, "... I will build my church, ..." Matt 16:18 (NIV)</li>
<li>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body,
I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Gal 2:20 (NIV)</li>
<li>Therefore, if anyone is
<u>in Christ</u>, that person is a new creation. The old has gone, the new is here! 2 Cor 5:17 (NIV)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is only as we live from our new nature that we are able to build with Jesus.</li>
<li>What Jesus builds will always reveal His nature. Will always reveal His Father's nature.</li>
<li>It is only as we abide in Him that we are able to reveal His nature that is within us as children of God.</li>
<li>Only from our new nature of love are we able to see as Jesus sees. If we don't see through His eyes we will build
using the incorrect blue print.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray
that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you,
<u>
<b>being rooted and established in love</b>
</u>, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the
love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the
fullness of God.</p>

<p>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work
within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
Eph 3:14-21 (NIV)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Rooted:</b> to render firm, to fix, establish, cause a person or a thing to be thoroughly grounded </li>
<li>
<b>Founded:</b> to lay the foundation </li>
<li>Jesus builds from His love and upon His love. </li>
</ul>

<p>Christ's love is the only foundation that is able to carry the "super structure" of what He is building.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your life</li>
<li>Your family</li>
<li>Your business</li>
<li>His church</li>
<li>This town</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Blue Print So Far:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prayer and fasting</li>
<li>New nature in Christ</li>
<li>Build from the new nature. Love builds.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Again I say...</h3>
<p>
<b>It is only in Christ that we are able to build together with God.</b>
</p>

<p>Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can
you bear fruit unless you remain in me. "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you,
you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. John 15:4-5 (NIV)</p>

<h3>Our Reality</h3>

<div style="text-align: center; float:left;">
<p>In Christ we are a new creation.</p>
<img src="../../images/down_arrow.png" alt="down arrow">
<p>In Christ we have a new nature.</p>
<img src="../../images/down_arrow.png" alt="down arrow">
<p>This nature is God's nature.</p>
<img src="../../images/down_arrow.png" alt="down arrow">
<p>God's nature is love.</p>
</div>
<br style="clear:both;">

<p>Build from love: (Truth, grace, mercy, peace)</p>
<ul>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Church</li>
<li>Community – 7 Mountains</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building Blocks</h3>
<p>With our new nature we build together with Jesus.</p>

<h4>How does Jesus build?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Holy Spirit</li>
<li>Word</li>
<li>Angels</li>
<li>5 Fold Ministry</li>
<li>Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>Our words.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>What will Sunday service look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching on what Jesus wants to build now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every Sunday after the teaching, every prayer meeting and every youth ministry we will spend the time together working
through what Jesus is saying. To become established in it so that there is a manifestation of that Truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>
<b>Prayer:</b>
</u> How do we build with Jesus a house of prayer?</li>
<li>
<u>
<b>Worship:</b>
</u> How do we build with Jesus a people of worship. Not a worship service but a people who worship God.</li>
<li>
<u>
<b>Teaching:</b>
</u> How does Jesus want to build the Word ministry?</li>
</ul>
