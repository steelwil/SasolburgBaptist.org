<h4>His Hand in Our Lives</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Through the Ages</strong></td>
<td>Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. <em>Galatians 3:16</em></td>
<td>There was a lot of history from Abraham to the birth of Christ. There were so many people involved and so much sin from Abraham to the birth of Christ, but God was sovereignly involved in brining through His promise and purpose through history.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>God is Involved</strong>
</td><td><p>A man's heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps. <em>Proverbs 16:9</em></p>
<p>Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. <em>Proverbs 16:9</em></p></td>
<td>Just as God was involved in history in ensuring that Christ was born at the right time in the right place with the right people, so is He involved in our lives and other people's lives as well.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Therefore Trust</strong></td>
<td>If we look back at our personal history we see that there is a thread, the hand of God, His sovereignty going through our lives.</td>
<td>Since God is involved we therefore need to trust in Him.</td></tr>
