<td><strong>Building the House</strong>
</td>
<td>"Prepare thy work without, And make it ready for thee in the field; And afterwards build thy house." <em>Proverbs 24:27</em></td>
<td>The house we need to build refers to the church, not the physical building but the people. Ministering in our community is part
of preparing the field.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>All Building Together</strong>
</td>
<td>So then, you Gentiles are not foreigners or strangers any longer; you are now citizens together with God's people and members of
the family of God. You, too, are built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, the cornerstone being Christ Jesus
himself. He is the one who holds the whole building together and makes it grow into a sacred temple dedicated to the Lord. In union
with him you too are being built together with all the others into a place where God lives through his Spirit. <em>Ephesians
2:19-22</em></td>
<td>The Apostle Paul did not mention any church in this Scripture and was talking about people and how they should <em>together</em>
grow and build the church of Christ. Together we are becoming the dwelling place of God.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Each Taking Their Responsibility</strong></td>
<td><p>Jesus is the owner of the church, but He has chosen to use sub-contractors (us) in his building process. Part of the
subcontractors He uses in the building process is the five-fold ministries. Every one of us who has a relationship with Jesus is
part of the building process.</p>

<p>We need to be faithful in our gift and our work to grow the church. In this the rest of the body is build up.</p>
</td>
<td>It was he who "gave gifts to people"; he appointed some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, others
to be pastors and teachers. He did this to prepare all God's people for the work of Christian service, in order to build up the
body of Christ. <em>Ephesians 4:11-12</em></td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Love is the Cement</strong></td>
<td><p>We are together as a family since we've been born again in one spirit through Jesus. The only thing that will keep us together
is love since there are so many differences between us.</p>

<p>The challenges we face in life are there to teach us to love more.</p></td>
<td>Under his control all the different parts of the body fit together, and the whole body is held together by every joint with
which it is provided. So when each separate part works as it should, the whole body grows and builds itself up through love.
<em>Ephesians 4:16</em></td>
