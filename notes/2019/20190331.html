<h3>Life Through the Spirit</h3>

<p>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <u>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.</u> Rom 8:1-2</p>

<p><u>Grace and peace </u>be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.His divine power has <u>given </u>us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may <u>participate in the divine nature</u>, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 2Pet 1:2-4</p>

<h3>Time to ponder.</h3>

<p style="font-size:smaller">Ponder: Think about (something) carefully, especially before making a decision or reaching a conclusion.</p>

<p>God is love.</p>

<p>Connect these attributes of love to God's love towards you.</p>

<p>Love is patient,<br>
    love is kind.<br>
    It does not envy,<br>
    It does not boast, it is not proud.<br>
    It does not dishonour others,<br>
    It is not self-seeking,<br>
    It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.<br>
    Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.<br>
    It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<br>
    Love never fails.</p>
