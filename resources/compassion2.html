<h4>To Open Your Heart to Someone in Need</h4>

<td><strong>Compassion Un-locker</strong></td>
<td><p>One of the keys in order for us to have a heart of compassion is to be like-minded with Christ. We have to experience the
compassion of God in our lives. And as we receive we have to give this compassion to others.</p></td>
<td>"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and
mercies, Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind." <em>Philippians 2:1-2</em></td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Imitators of Christ</strong></td>
<td>We have to be imitators of Christ in our walk of compassion.</td>
<td>"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind
one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." <em>Ephesians 4:31-32</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>A Commandment to All</strong></td>
<td>"Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:" <em>1 Peter 3:8</em></td>
<td>This is a commandment for all of us. Compassion must be a lifestyle.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Compassion's Reward</strong></td>
<td>"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? When thou seest the
naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
rearward. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger,
and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me." <em>Matthew
25:34-36</em></td>
<td><p>This is compassion in the context of judgement. This Scripture is alluding to the fact that if you have faith, then works will
follow and the test of genuine faith is an action.</p>

<p>We are faced with opportunities on a daily basis where we can put this teaching on compassion into action. We should use these
situations to practice compassion in order to become more like Christ. This Scripture in Matthew tells us that the reward for
compassion is great. Let us not lose out on this.</p></td>
