<h3>Covenant - 4</h3>

<h4>The result of covenant committed between a man and a woman can be summed up in one word: knowing. Union leads to knowing.</h4>
<p>"A man and a woman come to know each other in a depth and degree that is not possible in any other way." - <em>Derek Prince, Experiencing God's Power</em></p>

<td><strong>Knowing and Laying</strong></td>
<td>The writers of the Old Testament used the word "know" when they write about a sexual relationship between a husband and wife, but the use the word "lay" when they write about a sexual relationship between an unmarried man and woman.</td>
<td>
<p>There's a huge difference between knowing and laying. On the basis of a covenant you begin to know a woman, outside a covenant you lay with her.</p>
<p>Over a period of time the husband and wife really begin to know one another. Outside the covenant you cannot begin to experience this reality because there's no commitment.</p>

<td><strong>Covenant Leads to Knowing</strong></td>
<td class="even">"The time is coming," declares the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them," declares the Lord. "This is the covenant I will make&nbsp;with the&nbsp;house of Israel after that time," declares the Lord. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I
will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the&nbsp;least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord. <em>Jeremiah
31:31-34</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>The old covenant is based on a dead animal. But the new covenant&nbsp;is based on the living Son of God.</p>
<p>Covenant leads to knowing, union leads to knowing. Covenant in marriage leads to knowing one another. It is God's desire to have a spiritual union with every believer. It is His desire that we know Him. This is why Israel was called as a witness to
testify about their God that they knew.</p>

<td><strong>Our Adulterous Affairs</strong></td>
<td>The Lord said to me, "Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes." <em>Hosea 3:1</em></td>
<td>Israel often committed adultery with other foreign gods, but that did not stop God from loving Israel, because God made a covenant with Israel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Flesh and Spirit</strong></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other
blemish, but holy and blameless. <em>Ephesians 5:25-27</em></p>
<p>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mystery - but I am talking to you about Christ and the church. <em>Ephesians 5:31-32</em></p>
<p>Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The tow will become one in flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. <em>1 Corinthians 6:16-17</em></p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>Christ gave himself up for the church. This is covenant language. It shows the total commitment.</p>
<p>In the union between husband and wife they become one in flesh. In the union between us and God we become one in spirit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Eternal Life</strong></td>
<td>Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. <em>John 17:3</em></td>
<td>Here we see Jesus saying that the whole reality of eternal life is that we may know God. Covenant leads to knowing. For this reason we need to commit to Him&nbsp;and stop having&nbsp;an adulterous affair with the world.</td>
