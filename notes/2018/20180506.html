<h3>NEW LIFE IN CHRIST</h3>
<p>19 For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. Galatians 2:19-20 New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

<h3>The journey began</h3>
<p>This New Life in Christ.</p>
<p>The Journey to FREEDOM.</p>

<h3>FREEDOM</h3>
<h4><u>Meaning</u></h4>
<ol>
<li>The state of not being imprisoned or enslaved.</li>
<li>The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants.</li>
</ol>

<p>What then is FREEDOM within this New Life In Christ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom is not found in who I am but in the realization of who I am in Christ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Am I In Christ</h3>
<p>Romans 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>John 1:12 Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God</p>

<p>Romans 8:14 For those who are led by the <b>Spirit</b> of God are the children of God. 15 The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father." 16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. 17 Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</p>

<p>David understood the Freedom he had in God.</p>

<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>Galatians 5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.</p>

<h4>Life by the Spirit</h4>
<p>13 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. 14 For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." 15 If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. 16 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. Galatians 5:13-26 (NIV)</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</p>
