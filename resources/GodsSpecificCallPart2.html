<h4>All Are Called</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Sent Into the World</strong></td>
<td>There's a call of God and of salvation over our lives. So it doesn't matter where we go, as children of God, we hear this call as the Spirit of God works within us. This is because God loves us so much that He wants to bring us out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of His incredible love and mercy. We therefore need to respond to this call because the Holy Spirit needs to do work through us.</td>
<td>I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil <em>one</em>. They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth. As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth. <em>John 17:15-19</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Don't be Confused</strong></td>
<td>There is a mindset in the world that God only calls certain people and that not everyone is called. This is a false doctrine which is not true. All of us are called.</td>
<td>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace <em>be</em> unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. <em>John 20:21</em></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Lifting the Vail</strong></td>
<td><p>This common misconception that only some are called is in part caused by the misinterpretation of the scripture in Ephesians 4:11.</p>
<p>But, we need to read verse 12 together with verse 11. Part of the pastor's function is to equip the saints, but part of the saints' function is to do the work.</p></td>
<td><p>And he gave some <em>to be</em> apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;  <em>Ephesians 4:11</em></p>
<p>for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ: <em>Ephesians 4:12</em></p></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Called for a Role and a Purpose</strong></td>
<td><p>These scriptures confirm that all of us have a role to play. All of us are called.</p>
</td><td><p>but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, <em>even</em> Christ; from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in <em>due</em> measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love. <em>Ephesians 4:16</em></p>

<p>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. <em>Matthew 28:19-20</em></p></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Called Before the Beginning</strong></td>
<td>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations. <em>Jeremiah 1:5</em></td>
<td>God indeed has called us, even before we were born. The challenge is therefore for us to begin to evaluate the way we think about this calling.</td></tr>
