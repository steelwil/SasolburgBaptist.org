<h4>Purpose of the Desert</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Tough Love</strong></td>
<td>"So I am going to take her into the desert again; there I will win her back with words of love." <em>Hosea 2:14</em></td>
<td>The Lord sometimes leads His people into a desert for a purpose. He does not take us into the desert out of anger, but out of love.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>A Quiet Place</strong></td>
<td>In a natural desert all interferences from the outside world are removed. There is no cell phone signals, no radio signals.</td>
<td>Similarly, in life's deserts all distractions are removed. We become far more focused to survive. It's in the desert where it's just us and God.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>A Door of Hope</strong></td>
<td>"I will give back to her the vineyards she had and make Trouble Valley a door of hope. She will respond to me there as she did when she was young, when she came from Egypt." <em>Hosea 2:15</em></td>
<td>Every trial that we go through is a door of hope. The responsibility is therefore on us to find out why we are in a desert when we find ourselves there.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Changed in the Desert</strong>
</td><td>Then once again she will call me her husband - she will no longer call me her Baal." <em>Hosea 2:16</em></td>
<td><p>There is a metamorphosis or transformation that takes place in the desert. It is in the desert where we also learn the meaning of faith. In the desert character, perseverance and hope is formed. </p>
<p>The relationship changes when we come through the desert experience. The Lord changes from being the master to being the husband. </p></td></tr>
