<p>"Peter remembered and said to Jesus, 'Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!" <em>Mark 11:21</em></p>

<td class="even">"I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, 'The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.' "
<em>Ezra 8:32</em></td>
<td class="even">Everyone has a seed of faith that God placed inside of us. All we need to do is to speak it out. In the book of Ezra we see how the Church is a pilar of truth - putting their faith into practice.</td>

<p><strong>Believe in yourself</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">It's easier for us to say "the Spirit of the Lord is upon you", rather than "the Spirit is upon ME". This is very often due to doubt and unbelief we have in our hearts. We often don't see ourselves as being anointed, because we don't believe that we
are.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Don't be arrogant</strong></td>
<td>"After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet, trying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.<em>" John 13:5</em></td>
<td>We're not saying that you have to be arrogant, all we're saying is that you need to know (and believe) who you are. Jesus knew who He was, and yet He showed no arrogance.</td>
