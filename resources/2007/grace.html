<p>"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is
preferred before me: for he was before me. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." <em>John 1:14-17</em></p>
</td>
<td>The love of God is so awesome that despite us being so full of sin He made provision by sending His Son so that we can come into this realm of the Father's favour.</td>

<p><strong>Access to Grace</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." <em>Romans 5:1-2</em></td>
<td class="even">The word 'access' can also be seen as meaning 'introduction'. We need someone to introduce us to God Almighty. Jesus introduces us to this realm of the favour of God.</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Not Deserved</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace
to help in time of need." <em>Hebrews 4:15-16</em></td>
<td>
<p>The Scriptures uses words like loyalty, mercy, kindness, undeserve favour, forgiveness to try and give a description of what grace is about. Grace is the favour of God over us despite us. We do not deserve it.</p>
<p>God in His grace treats us, though guilty, as if we have never sinned.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Perfect in Weakness</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">God's grace compensates for our weaknesses. This is good news for us since we don't have to be perfect. We still need to do our best, but at least we can relax a bit.</td>
<td class="even">"And he said unto me, 'My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.' " <em>II Corinthians 12:9</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Return the Favour</strong></p>
</td>
<td>How do we know that we have the Father's grace over our lives? All we need do is to look back over our lives and to see the goodness of the Father where we did not deserve it.</td>
<td>
<p>God also calls us as his children to walk in grace towards others. This means that undeserved favour, kindness, mercy compassion and generosity&nbsp;have to be found in human relationships. Tough!? Then we understand God's position with us.</p>
