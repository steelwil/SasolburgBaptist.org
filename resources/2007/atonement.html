<p>"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
atonement." <em>Romans 5:10-11</em></p>

<p><strong>Four Vital Elements</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">What are the different components concerning atonement?</td>
<td class="even">
<p>With atonement, there is firstly an offense that needs to be removed. Secondly, the person against whom the offense has been committed needs to be pacified. Thirdly, there is the guilty person that have committed the offense. And
fourthly, a sacrifice needs to be made in order to bring reconciliation. <em>John Owen</em></p>

<p><strong>Why Do We Need Atonement</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;" &nbsp;<em>Romans 1:18</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." <em>Romans 5:9</em></p>
</td>
<td>Sin provokes God's anger. We are sinners and God is in opposition to this sin in us. This is why we cannot be one with God, hence the reconciliation, the atonement.</td>

<p><strong>Restored</strong></p>
