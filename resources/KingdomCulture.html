<h4>Propagated Through Each of Us</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>In the Beginning</strong></td><td><p>Since the beginning of creation It was always God's intention to make known the reality of His Kingdom on earth. Adam and Eve experienced the culture of heaven in the Garden of Eden.</p><p>However, after the fall of man, man tried to govern the earth out of his independent spirit and not from the born again spirit. This was when the culture of the kingdom of darkness started to spread all over the earth.</p></td>
<td><p>As a result we saw the first murder taking place where Cain murdered Abel. <em>Genesis 4:8 </em>"... And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."</p></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Re-establish His Culture</strong></td>
<td>God then chose Noah and his family to implement the kingdom culture on earth.</td>
<td>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. <em>Genesis 6:13 and 6:18</em></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Help to Everyone</strong></td>
<td>Throughout the Bible we see that it is the will of God to establish His kingdom on earth. This is why Jesus had to return to heaven so that all of us living on earth could be given help to establish the Kingdom culture on earth.</td>
<td>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you. And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: <em>John 16:8-9</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Wisdom Through the Spirit</strong></td>
<td>For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God. <em>1 Corinthians 2:12-13</em></td>
<td>Everyday we see how the world doesn't have solutions to the many problems we're facing. But as a believer we have the Spirit of God who knows the mind of the Father. We'll be stupid to ignore the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>The Culture Revealed</strong></td>
<td>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, ...If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk. <em>Galatians 5:22 &amp; 5:25</em></td>
<td>This is the culture of God and we are called to walk in it. Our earthly culture has to submit to the culture of God since we are no longer citizens of the world, but are citizens of heaven.</td></tr>
