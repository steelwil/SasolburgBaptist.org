<h4>Surpasses Our Understanding</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr>
<td><strong>Not Our Understanding</strong></td>
<td>We are so used to taking the first thought that comes into our mind and we apply that. We become accustomed to living on man's
wisdom (a lower level of wisdom) and we miss out on the wealth of wisdom that God has for us.</td>
<td><p>Trust in the LORD with all your heart. Never rely on what you think you know. <em>Proverbs 3:5</em></p>

<p>My child, learn what I teach you and never forget what I tell you to do. Listen to what is wise and try to understand it. Yes,
beg for knowledge; plead for insight. Look for it as hard as you would for silver or some hidden treasure. If you do, you will know
what it means to fear the LORD and you will succeed in learning about God. <em>Proverbs 2:1-5</em></p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Loyalty and Faithfulness</strong></td>
<td>Never let go of loyalty and faithfulness. Tie them around your neck; write them on your heart. If you do this, both God and
people will be pleased with you. <em>Proverbs 3:3-4</em></td>
<td><p>God often demonstrates his love through people. As our hearts expands, more of His love can be demonstrated through us.</p>

<p>To love is a practical expression of what's in our hearts. This is why we ought to wear love around our neck so that others can
see it.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Strive for Love</strong></td>
<td>But you, man of God, avoid all these things. Strive for righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness. <em>1
Thessalonians 6:11</em></td>
<td>The word requests us to leave all the things of the world and to pursue the things of God. One of the things we should pursue is
love.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Learn to Love</strong></td>
<td>We should learn to express love to others, but how do we do that? The Scripture gives us practical ways on how to love and we
are faced with these types of situations on a daily basis.</td>
<td>Love is patient and kind; it is not jealous or conceited or proud; love is not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable; love does
not keep a record of wrongs; love is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth. Love never gives up; and its faith, hope,
and patience never fail. Love is eternal. There are inspired messages, but they are temporary; there are gifts of speaking in
strange tongues, but they will cease; there is knowledge, but it will pass. <em>1 Corinthians 13:4-9</em></td>
