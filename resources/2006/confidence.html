<p>"These things I have written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God" <em>1 John 5:13</em></p>
<p>"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. &nbsp;He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected:
hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked." <em>1 John 2:2-6</em></p>

<p>In the Scriptures John don't only want the church to know that they are SAVED, he also wants them to KNOW GOD. Salvation is only a doorway in the relationship with God.</p>
</td>
<td>"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and
this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." <em>1 John 2:2-4</em></td>

<p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways." <em>James 1:5-8</em></p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>Our confidence should not be based on our ability or what we see. Our confidence should be based on God's confidence and what He teaches us in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The reason why we don't know the will of God is because we don't seek it. We need to spend time in His Word to seek His will.</p>

<p>"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: &nbsp;And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him." <em>1 John
5:14,15</em></p>
</td>

<p>Very often we come to the Father with so much doubt in our hearts. We need to be in a place of confidence when we approach God. We need to be so assured that when we speak to God, He will answer us.</p>
