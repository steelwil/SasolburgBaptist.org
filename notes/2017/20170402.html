<h3>Building Kingdom Families – Righteousness and its rewards.</h3>
<p>"He who <em>receives</em> you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Anyone who receives
a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a <em>righteous</em>
man because he is a righteous man <em>will receive a righteous man's reward.</em>" Matt 10:40-41 (NIV)</p>

<h3>Characteristics of God's Kingdom</h3>
<ul>
<li>The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking,<em> but of righteousness, peace and joy</em> in the Holy Spirit.
Romans 14:17 (NIV)</li>
<li>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. 1 Cor. 4:20 (NIV)
<ul>
<li>Righteous</li>
<li>Peace</li>
<li>Joy</li>
<li>Power</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kingdom of God within and among us.</h3>
<p>Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, 'Here it is', because
the kingdom of God <em>is within</em> you." Luke 17:20-21 (NIV)</p>

<p>Before one can administrate God's kingdom within ones family, it needs to be a reality within ones own heart.</p>

<p>The evidence that Christ rules in <u>ones</u> own heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Righteousness</li>
<li>Peace</li>
<li>Joy in the Holy Spirit</li>
<li>Mighty power of God in action</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jesus Christ the Righteous One.</h3>
<p>"The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth." Acts
22:14 (NIV)</p>

<p>"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father
in our defence – Jesus Christ, the Righteous One." 1 John 2:1 (NIV)</p>

<p>We who receive Jesus, receive the rewards of His righteousness.</p>

<h3>The Rewards of Christs Righteousness</h3>
<p>"For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant
provision of <em>grace</em> and of the <em>gift of righteousness reign in life</em> through the one
man, Jesus Christ." Rom 5:17 (NIV)</p>

<p>"So that, just as sin reigned in death, so also <em>grace</em> might <em>reign</em> through <em>righteousness</em>
to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ." Rom 5:21 (NIV)</p>

<ul>
<li>Grace reigns</li>
<li>Righteousness reigns</li>
<li>Life (Death being the separation from the life of God.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Grace: It is all of God working in ones life by the Holy Spirit. The wholly generous act of God in the experience of man
by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Righteousness: In a right standing with God just as if I had never sinned.</p>

<p>Life: God's eternal life. His Life is in me.</p>
