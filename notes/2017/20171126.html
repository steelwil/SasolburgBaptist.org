<h3>The Power of God's Love</h3>

<p>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! 1 John 3:1</p>

<p>For Christ didn't send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News—and not with clever speech, for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power.</p>

<p>The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God. 1 Cor 1:17-18 (NLT)</p>

<p>This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. 1 John 3:16 (NIV)</p>

<p>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.  1 John 4:8-10 (NIV)</p>

<p>The Cross of Christ = The Cross of Love</p>

<h3>The Power of Love</h3>

<p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking,
it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. 1 Cor 13:4-8b (NIV)</p>
