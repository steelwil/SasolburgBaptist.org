<h4>Pathway of God's Love</h4>
<h4>Power of Christ's Love and Blood</h4>

<p>14 For this reason I kneel before the <u>Father</u>, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his <u>Spirit</u> in your inner being, so that <u>Christ</u> may <b>dwell in your hearts</b> through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be <u>filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</u> 20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen. Eph 3:14-21 NIV</p>

<p>For it is <b>Christ's love that fuels our passion and motivates</b> us, because we are absolutely convinced that he has given his life for all of us. This means all died with him, so that those who live <b>should no longer live self-absorbed lives but lives that are poured out for him</b> —the one who died for us and now lives again. So then, from now on, we have a new perspective that refuses to evaluate people merely by their outward appearances. 2 Cor 5:14-16</p>

<p>When the seventy missionaries returned to Jesus, they were ecstatic with joy, telling him, "Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we commanded them in your name!" Jesus replied, "While you were ministering, I watched Satan topple until he fell suddenly from heaven like lightning to the ground. Now you understand that I have imparted to you all my authority to trample over his kingdom. You will trample upon every demon before you and overcome every power Satan possesses. Absolutely nothing will be able to harm you as you walk in this authority. However, your real source of joy isn't merely that these spirits submit to your authority, but that your names are written in the journals of heaven and that you belong to God's kingdom. This is the true source of your authority." Luke 10:17-20</p>

<p>1.Our faith in Jesus transfers God's righteousness to us and he now declares us flawless in his eyes. This means we can now enjoy true and lasting peace with God, all because of what our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, has done for us. 2.Our faith guarantees us permanent access into this marvellous kindness that has given us a perfect relationship with God. What incredible joy bursts forth within us as we keep on celebrating our hope of experiencing God's glory! 3.But that's not all! Even in times of trouble we have a joyful confidence, knowing that our pressures will develop in us patient endurance. 4.And patient endurance will refine our character, and proven character leads us back to hope. 5.And this hope is not a disappointing fantasy, <b>because we can now experience the endless love of God cascading into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who lives in us!</b> Rom 5:1-5 TPT</p>

<h4>Power of Christ's blood - Redemption</h4>

<p>(1) <em>Agorazo</em>, which means to purchase in the market.</p>

<p>The scene is that of a slave market, and the sinner is pictured as being in slavery, a bond-slave to sin, or as Paul says "sold under sin" (Romans 7:14). He is dominated by Satan (Ephesians 2:2), condemned (John 3:18), sentenced to die, for "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). The Son of God became our Kinsman-Redeemer when "He also Himself likewise took part of the same (flesh and blood)" (Hebrews 2:14), took the place of the sinner-slave, was made a curse for us, and shed His Blood as the ransom-price of our redemption (Matthew 20:28). When He made the purchase in the market, He paid for every sinner-slave who was in bondage to sin, so that redemption was provided for all. (See I Corinthians 6:20; 7:23; and II Peter 2:1). This is <em>agorazo</em>, the purchasing in the market. Power of Christ's blood - Redemption</p>

<p>(2) <em>Exagorazo</em>, which means to purchase out of the market.</p>

<p>But redemption is more than merely paying the price. After our Kinsman-Redeemer paid for us in the market, then He took us out of the market. He has taken us out of the market so that we shall never again be for sale or exposed to the lot of a slave. Of course He takes out of the market only those who will go with Him, and when the sinner is willing to trust his Redeemer Who paid the ransom price, he is assured of deliverance from the hopelessly enslaved condition of bondage to sin. This goes beyond <em>agorazo</em>, the mere payment of the requisite price in the slave market. It takes us out of the market. This is <em>exagorazo</em></p>

<p>(3) <em>Lutroo</em>, which means to loosen and set free.</p>

<p>The third Greek word used to translate redemption is <em>Lutroo</em>, and it indicates that the redeemed one is "loosened" or "set free."</p>

<p>(3 Definitions by <em>Lehman Strauss</em> : The Atonement of Christ)</p>

<h4>Fear of God</h4>
<p>We need to understand that within us there is the all-seeing, all-knowing, omnipresent God. That is an awesome thing. God who has created the universe, and everything in it, has chosen to come and dwell within us. We become a habitation of God. We have to prepare that place for Him to dwell. The all-consuming fire of God is on the inside of us. Fear of God is not the same as being afraid of Him. If I know God's love, I will not be afraid of Him. But this is an awesome thing, to have Him dwell within us, and He wants us to know the awesomeness of His presence.</p>

<h4>Reverence</h4>
<p>Honouring and respecting God. We will do nothing that will bring His Name into disrepute or dishonour. We will seek to bring honour to Him.</p>

<h4>Prayer</h4>
<p>That is not getting on our knees, putting our hands together, and finishing it off with 'Amen'. It is about two-way communication, where the Spirit of God, where the mind of Christ, where the heart of the Father, are flowing through us in relationship. That is why praying in tongues is so important: it is our spirit praying and communicating with God. And we can do that without ceasing, if we train it to continue even when our conscious mind is elsewhere.</p>

<h4>Hope</h4>
<p>That sense where visions and dreams and opportunities are flowing, where God shows us His will.</p>

<h4>Faith</h4>
<p>Faith Harmony, concord, understanding, knowing: where we come together in agreement with God. We start to operate in the gifts of the Holy Spirit in the power of God as He flows through us.</p>

<h4>Revelation</h4>
<p>Inspiration, light, counsel, wisdom.</p>

<h4>Intuition</h4>
<p>Gut feeling, instinct, knowing, as the Holy Spirit reveals the Father's heart to us.</p>

<h4>Worship</h4>
<p>Worship is not singing. It is a state of complete obedience to God. It is complete surrender and total submission to the will of God for our lives, on a daily basis. Everything else that is flowing within us will lead to us saying, 'God I choose to surrender myself to you'. That is what He wants us to do.</p>

<h4>Conscience</h4>
<p>Our conscience is the ears of our heart. It is our protector and our director, our guard, and our guide. Our conscience will keep us from wrong and direct us to good. Sadly, our conscience can be dulled or seared by repeated exposure to sin ( Titus 1:15 ). We need our conscience cleansed, clear and sharp.</p>

<h4>Reason</h4>
<p>It is not that we reason and try to work it out with intellect: this is about being able to translate and interpret the words of God that are spoken to us, to understand and explain God's word as He speaks to us.<p>

<h4>Mind</h4>
<p>Our mind, conscious and subconscious, is where the storage programs are. Here we find our memories, the word of God, and belief systems. It is like the hard drive of a computer. Everything is stored there.</p>

<h4>Imagination</h4>
<p>The eyes of our heart. It is absolutely key that we develop our imagination. Our western culture and education system have trained us out of using (and valuing) our imagination. Our imagination was given to us by God so that we could see what He is doing. So that we could see visions, see dreams, see the heavenly realms, on the screen of our imagination. We need to learn how to use it again and train it so that it grows and develops.</p>

<h4>Emotions</h4>
<p>Our soul has emotions, where our responses and our feelings are, where we are moved, where we get those gut feelings. Emotions affect our esteem, our worth, whether we feel love, security, acceptance and value.<p/>

<h4>Will</h4>
<p>We also have a will. If we sin, through stubbornness or rebellion, our will is damaged and effectively becomes a barrier to what God wants to do. That sets up such things as unbelief, indecision, control, doubt and fear. As we deal with them, God wants to replace them with humility, confidence, boldness, courage, persistence, determination, perseverance, self-control (which is a fruit of the Spirit). All those things can happen if we allow God from the inside out to transform our life.</p>

<h4>Choice</h4>
<p>The final gate is choice. In the end, it all comes down to one question. Once we have cleared out everything which would lead us away from surrendering to God and allowing our spirit to rule, we still have to make a conscious,daily choice. What will we choose to do?</p>
