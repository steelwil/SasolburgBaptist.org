<tr><td><strong>Covenant With God Means Covenant With Each Other</strong></td><td><p>"And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel." <em>Exodus 19:3-6</em></p></td><td><p>Israel were to become this precious people of God based on a covenant.</p><p>Later in Exodus 20 God gives the 10 Commandments and begins to teach the people of Israel how they should relate towards each other based on the covenant He made. Those that have a covenant relationship with God, has a covenant relationship with each other.</p></td></tr> 
<tr><td><p><strong>The New Standard</strong></p></td><td class="even"><p>"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducee's to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' " <em>Matthew 22:34-40</em></p></td><td class="even">Jesus takes the relationship that existed under the old covenant further with this text. In the old covenant 'self' was the standard, now the standard moves to a higher plane that is Christ Jesus. The new standard is about dying to self and living for your neighbour.</td></tr> 
<tr><td><strong>Togetherness</strong></td><td><p>"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others." <em>Philippians 2:1-4</em></p></td><td>This is covenant language. It is no longer "I" who lives, but it is about a togetherness. Dying to self. Covenant teaches us that what is mine is yours and what is yours is mine.</td></tr> 
<tr><td><p><strong>One in Christ</strong></p></td><td class="even"><p>"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 'Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.'" <em>Matthew 26:27-28</em></p><p>"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread" <em>1 Corinthians 10:16-17</em></p><p>"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me" <em>John 17:22-23</em></p></td><td class="even">Although we are many people (different cultures, races, languages, etc.) in Christ we become one. We see that there is a bonding, a relationship that exists amongst one another based on the covenant that Christ made. The criteria is for us to love one another as Christ have loved us.</td></tr> 
<tr><td><p><strong>A People in Christ</strong></p></td><td>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy." <em>1 Peter 2:9-10</em></td><td>Based on the covenant we become a people in Christ. Therefore as a body of Christ there's a way for us to live. Jesus explains throughout the New Testament how we are to live with one another.</td></tr> 
<tr><td><p><strong>Father and Son Union</strong></p></td><td class="even"><p>"I and my Father are one." <em>John 10:30</em></p><p>"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you." <em>John 16:13-15</em></p><p>"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them." <em>John 17:10</em></p></td><td class="even"><p>This is koinonia! The world has not seen this yet! We are all too selfish for this. </p><p>All that the Father has is ours! Do we know what this means? We will never lack! No matter where we go or what we do, whatever we need for that situation, we will not lack because of a covenant relationship between the Father and the Son.</p></td></tr> 
<tr><td><p><strong>Walking in the Light</strong></p></td><td>The criteria for knowing one another is walking in the light. We will only begin to know koinonia when we live in the light. </td><td>"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, w lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." <em>1 John 1:6-7</em></td></tr>
