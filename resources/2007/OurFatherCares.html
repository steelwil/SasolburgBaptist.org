<h4>He'll Meet Our Needs</h4>

<td><strong>Our Father Sees Everything</strong></td>
<td>"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms
may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly." <em>Matthew 6:3-4</em></td>
<td>We should keep on doing what we're doing and let God worry about the reward Nothing escapes the
Father's eyes.</td>

<td><strong>He Knows your Need</strong></td>
<td>"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be
heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him." <em>Matthew 6:7-8</em></td>
<td>This should give us confidence in our future. He knows what we need. He has been prepared for our needs since before
we were born.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>It Shall Be Given</strong></td>
<td>"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you:" <em>Matthew 7:7</em></td>
<td>This Scripture shows the generosity of the Father. We also see in the Scriptures that Jesus turned no one away that
came for healing. He was revealing his Father.</td>
