<h4>A binding agreement between two or more parties. To set somthing out in order between; setting forth of specific terms and conditions. A solemn agreement or promise by
which two or more parties commit themselves to the rights and responsibilities demanded by their relationship and their agreed course of action and in which they accept the consequences of breaking the covenant.</h4>

<td><strong>Diligence in Searching the Word</strong></td>
<td>
<p>"My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding, and if you call our for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and search for it as for hidden treasure, then
you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding." <em>Proverbs 2:1-6</em></p>
</td>
<td>There is a diligence in seeking the treasures in God's word. The word of God is more valuable than any other treasure on earth, but it is not easy to get. You have to press in in your own quiet time.</td>

<td><strong>Covenant vs. Testiment</strong></td>
<td class="even">
<p>The English translation of the Hebrew word for covenant means either covenant (as in agreement)&nbsp;or testament (in the legal sense).</p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>The Bible make no distinction between the testiment and covenant. Old Testiment is therefore old covenant and New Testiment is new covenant.</p>

<p><strong>Power of Covenant</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>"This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people." <em>Hebrews 8:10</em></p>
<p>"The Lord confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them." <em>Psalm 25:14</em></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The understanding of the nature of a covenant is crucial for us as Christians. The written revelation of the Old Testemant and New Testament comes through covenant. If we understand the backing that comes with this covenant, we will never doubt the
Word of God again.</p>
<p>When God makes a covenant, there is no more He can do. It is binding and final.</p>

<td><strong>Seriousness of Covenant</strong></td>
<td class="even">In 1 Kings 5:12 Solomon makes a covenant with the King of Tyre.&nbsp;In Amos 1:9&nbsp;we see that God is about to bring judgement over Tyre because they broke covenant with Israel.</td>
<td class="even">So although there was a human covenant, it is noted in heaven. This shows that covenant is a very serious thing in the heart of God. A covenant is a relationship that is initiated by God.</td>

<td><strong>The Danger of Breaking Covenant</strong></td>

<p><strong>Dead to Self</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"He also said to him, 'I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.' But Abram said, 'O Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?' So the Lord said to him, 'Bring me
a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.' Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other, the birds, however, he did not but in half. <em>Genesis 15:7-10</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>In a covenant there is blood and a&nbsp;sacrifice. The animal sacrifice is cut in two and the people entering into the covenant walk between the two halves of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Why is&nbsp;a sacrifice necesarry when God is making a covenant with man? It is because as the person walks through the two halves of the sacrifice, what they are saying to each other is that represents my death. In other words, I no longer live for
myself, I live for you know. I am dead to my own rights. In a covenant agreement, it is YOU and ME.</p>

<p><strong>What's Mine is Yours</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>In a covenant relationship, the two parties are saying: When the enemy comes, my sword is your sword; when you are in lack, my supply is your supply.</p>
<p>Because of covenant I no longer only look after my own interest, but I look after your interest as well. In fact, your interest takes precedence over my interest.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Abram understood this. This is&nbsp;why when God told him to sacrifice his son, Abram did not hesitate. He understood that everything that was his was God's.</p>
<p>God made a promise to Abram that He will bless Abram's descendants. So when the time came for God to bless Abram's descendents, God sent His Son. That is the essence covenant. God's Son is Abram's son, Abram's son is God's son.</p>

<p><strong>Why Jesus Died</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>The animal sacrifice made in a covenant represents the death of the parties involved, just as Christ represents our death.</p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance - now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant." <em>Hebrews
9:15</em></p>

<p><strong>Now God's Army is Our Army</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say 'and
to seeds,' meaning many people, but 'and to you seed,' meaning one person, who is Christ.</td>
<td>
<p>When God is making a promise and a covenant with Abraham, He is making it to His Son Jesus Christ. This is why Jesus teach us to pray in His name. Because whatever belongs to the Father belongs to the Son (John 16:14-15).</p>
<p>For this reason we can in boldness go to the throne of God when we are in need. Because of covenant, God's army is our&nbsp;army.</p>
