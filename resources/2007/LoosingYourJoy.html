<td><strong>Joy in Trials</strong></td>
<td>"My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations" <em>James 1:2</em></td>
<td>How can we be full of joy when we are facing life's trials? This is a tough ask.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Where to Focus</strong></td>
<td>We get despondent when we're in a trial because we fix our eyes on the situation. Looking at the
situation inspires fear within us.</td>
<td>"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." <em>Hebrews 12:2</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Trials Makes Us Stronger</strong></td>
<td>The trails we're facing are in actual fact a gift from God. It's there to help us to depend more on Him and our faith is increased every time He comes through for us.</td>
<td>"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
called according to his purpose." <em>Romans 8:28</em></td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Faith and Sin</strong></td>
<td>Not to have faith is to sin. If we have doubt and unbelief in our hearts we're sinning against God.</td>
<td>"And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not
of faith is sin." <em>Romans 14:23</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Joy Through Faith</strong></td>
<td>"So then faith <em>cometh</em> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." <em>Romans 10:17</em></td>
<td><p>The number one reason we loose our joy is because we're putting down our shield of faith. Faith is a confident expectation of a future outcome.</p>
<p>Faith and joy are interlinked because where there's faith, there's hope, and where there's hope, there's joy.</p></td>
