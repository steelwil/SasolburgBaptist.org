<tr><td><strong>The Spirit Within You</strong></td>
<td><em>Even</em> the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you. <em>John 14:17</em></td>
<td>Every believer has the Holy Spirit in them.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Living Waters Within You</strong></td>
<td>Now on the last day, the great <em>day</em> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water. <em>John 7:37-38</em></td>
<td>Every believer has the streams of living waters within them. It is the Holy Spirit that brings life to every believer. So we have the life of God within us.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Power from Within</strong>
</td><td>And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power <em>proceeding</em> from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? <em>Mark 5:30</em></td>
<td>Here in Mark 5:24-34 we see the account of how a woman suffering from an illness for twelve years touched Jesus' garment and was healed by His power. The power of God was there with the presence of Jesus.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Power Outside of Them</strong></td>
<td>And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed <em>them</em> all. <em>Luke 6:19</em></td>
<td>These people reached out to a power that was <em>outside</em> of them and the power was released from <em>within</em> Jesus.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Power Present Outside</strong></td>
<td>One day when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the Law were sitting there who had come from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present for Jesus to heal the sick. <em>Luke 5:17</em></td>
<td>This verse is different from the previous two scriptures in that the power was from outside of Jesus. The power was not from within Him.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Learn to Connect to the Power</strong></td>
<td>It is easy to worship when we're in church and there's a power of glory present, but it's another thing when the power is not there. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we don't feel the presence or power of God. What do we do then? What do we do when God sends someone into our lives and we have to minister to them, but we don't feel the power of God?</td>
<td>This is when we have to reach within ourselves and connect to the power for God. God has been giving us the knowledge of the resurrection power of Christ and of the power and life we have inside of us (John 7:37-38). During those times when we feel empty inside we have to speak to the Holy Spirit and make the connection with God. As we connect with God we connect to His power.</td></tr>
