<p>"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which
they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation." <em>1 Peter 2:11</em></p>
<p>"Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf." <em>1 Peter 4:16</em></p>
</td>
<td>We need to rejoice that we carry the name of Christ. With this comes a responsibility in how we live our lives as Christians; a responsibility to keep the name of the Lord high, even if it means that we have to suffer for it.</td>

<td class="even">"And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before
God. And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day." <em>1</em><em>Chronicles 13:9-11</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Deep down we want our name to be associated with God's glory. As humans we have that pull inside of us to have our name mentioned.&nbsp;We need to understand is that we cannot usher in God's glory with our own agendas. It is God's glory. We should not
get our hands on His glory to dirty and stain it with our polluted ideologies. This is one of the lessons from this story of Uzza in this&nbsp;Scripture.</p>

minister unto him for ever." <em>1</em><em>Chronicles 15:1-2</em></td>
