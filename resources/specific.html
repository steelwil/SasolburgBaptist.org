<td><strong>Thanks for the Saved</strong></td>
<td>
<p>"We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you," <em>Colossians 1:3</em></p>
</td>
<td>Paul is thanking God for the church because the church is full of sinners that are saved. He also showed a commitment to not stop praying as can be seen from the text.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Continuous Commitment</strong></td>
<td class="even">"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding," <em>Colossians 1:9</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Once again Paul shows his commitment in prayer. It is not a once off prayer, but a commitment. He asked God to give the church definite and specific information about the knowledge of God. Not a general information about the will of God, but a specific
information.</p>
<p>As we walk with God He become more specific. This is the sign of growth. However, it's also the cause of tension inside of us since this requires a sacrifice and more obedience.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Increasing in Knowledge</strong></td>
<td>"to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;" <em>Colossians1:10</em></td>
<td>Here we see that it's possible for us to please God. But we have to know what the definite will of God is in order for us to please Him. This is why it's important for us to increase in the knowledge of God. In so doing we will bear fruit and produce
results.</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>How to Please God</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and so shall ye be my disciples." <em>John 15:8</em></td>
<td class="even">As we bear fruit and produce results we are showing evidence of Christ's character. This is how God is glorified.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Obedience</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." <em>John 15:10</em></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We have to be obedient after obtaining the specific knowledge about God's will. We will produce results when we walk in the will of God.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Not Our Strength</strong></td>
<td class="even">
<p>"whereunto I labor also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily." <em>Colossians 1:29</em></p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>We cannot do this by ourselves. We need to appropriate Christ's energy since most of us are at the end of our human energy and are about to burn out. May God open our eyes to understand the power of Christ in us.</p>
