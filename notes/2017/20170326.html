<p>Listen to the sermon:

</p>

<h3>Kingdom of God within and among us.</h3>
<p>Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, 'Here it is,'
because the kingdom of God is within you." Luke 17:20-21 (NIV)
</p>

<p>Before one can administrate Gods kingdom within ones family, it needs to be a reality within ones own heart.</p>

<p>The evidence that Christ rules in ones
<u>own</u> heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Righteousness</li>
<li>Peace</li>
<li>Joy in the Holy Spirit</li>
<li>Mighty power of God in action</li>
</ul>

<h3>Administrating Gods Kingdom: (Light shining in the darkness)</h3>
<p>"Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.
For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves." Col
1:12-13 (NIV)
</p>

<p>"God is light: in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness,
we lie and do not live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light..." 1 John 1:5-7 (NIV)</p>

<p>"Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did" 1 John 1:6 (NIV)</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide which kingdom you are going to administrate/ advance. "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, Gods special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness
into his wonderful light." 1 Peter 2:9 (NIV)</li>

<li>Abide in the Light (Jesus) in order to administrate Gods kingdom. "...if you remain in me and I in you, you will
bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." John 15:5 (NIV)</li>

<li>The Righteous will live by faith. "So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by
the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?" Gal 3:5 (NIV) (Gal 5:6)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Righteousness:</h3>
<p>The righteousness that God imputes to us when he declares us righteous through faith even when we are guilty sinners.
(Romans 4:5).
</p>

<p>The free gift of righteousness impacts our living and behaviour. We can now live righteously. We do this by walking
in the Spirit. "And to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness." Eph 4:24
(NIV) (Romans 6:13, 16, 18, 19, 20).</p>

<h3>Administrating Righteousness.</h3>
<p>"He who <em>receives</em> you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Anyone who receives
a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophets reward, and anyone who receives a <em>righteous</em>            man because he is a righteous man <em>will receive a righteous mans reward.</em>" Matt 10:40-41 (NIV)</p>

<p>"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some <em>worthy</em> person and stay at his <em>home</em>... As you
enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is <em>deserving</em>, let your peace rest on it; if it is
not, let your peace return to you." Matt 10:11-12 (NIV)</p>

<p>"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to the pigs." Matt 7:6 (NIV)</p>

<h4><u>A Worthy Person:</u> (Having weight, value, worth)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Someone who is open to the message.</li>
<li>They see that the message and messenger has great value.</li>
<li>Shows hospitality.</li>
<li>Receive you.</li>
<li>Honour you.</li>
</ul>

<h4><u>An Unworthy Person:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>Someone who rejects the message and the messenger.</li>
<li>There is no honour.</li>
<li>The door is closed.</li>
</ul>

<h4><u>Righteous Mans Reward:</u></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Powerful and effective prayer.</strong><br />
"The prayer of a righteous man is powerful (mighty) and effective (it works)." James 5:16b (NIV)</li>

<li><strong>His mouth brings life.</strong> (Declare righteousness)<br />
"The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life..." Prov 10:11 (NIV) (Romans 5:1; 2 Cor 5:16-21.)</li>

<li><strong>His leadership brings a sense of safety and security.</strong><br />
"The steps of a good (righteous) man are ordered by the
Lord...though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down; for the LORD upholds him with His hand. Psalm 37:23-24
(NKJV)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Declaring Gods Kingdom.</h3>

<p>"When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not,
it will return to you." Luke 10: 5-6 (NIV)</p>

<p>God is righteous therefore His Word is righteous. When we declare, speak Gods Word, the righteousness of God is manifesting.</p>

<p>"For the Word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double – edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and
spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden
from Gods sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account."
Heb 4:12-13 (NIV)</p>

<p>Administrate Joy and Power.</p>

<p>Our love and obedience to Jesus brings joy to others.</p>

<p>"Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous
signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and
many paralytics and cripples were healed. So there was great joy in that city." Acts 8:6-7 (NIV)</p>

<p>(Luke 10:17-21; John 15: 9-11)</p>
