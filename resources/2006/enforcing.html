<td><strong>God's Love in Us</strong></td>
<td>Everyone who has a relationship with Jesus have the fullness of God's love within them.&nbsp;</td>
<td>"and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us." <em>Romans 5:5</em></td>

<p>"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh." <em>Galatians 5:16</em></p>

<p>It's one thing being baptised by the Holy Spirit, it's another thing receiving the Holy Spirit but it's another to continuously walking with the Spirit.</p>

<td><strong>Becoming a Reality</strong></td>
<td>
<p>As we continuously walk with the Holy Spirit and giving in to the Holy Spirit we find the manifestation of the Spirit becoming a reality through our lives.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>"But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law."&nbsp; <em>Galatians 5:18</em></p>
</td>

<p><strong>Direction and Revelation Through Prayer</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ."</td>
<td class="even">Here we see Paul praying and we notice that prayer plays a major role in God giving us a revelation.</td>

<p><strong>The Sinful Nature</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high." <em>Isaiah 58:4</em></td>
<td>This is the typical character of our sinful nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>God's Love</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are
cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?" <em>Isaiah 58:6-7</em></td>
<td class="even">Here we see the manifestation of God's love. The outworking of a heart that is yielded to the Holy Spirit. We cannot love and turn our backs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>The New Revival</strong></p>
</td>
<td>The new revival is not from above down, but from within out.&nbsp;</td>
<td>"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward." <em>Isaiah 58:8</em></td>
