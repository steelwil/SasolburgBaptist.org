<td><strong>A Place of Honour</strong></td>
<td>"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in
that which is to come:" <em>Ephesians 1:20-21</em></td>
<td>The Holy Spirit is showing us the position of Jesus in a place of extreme favour, where everything is placed under His feet. It is a position of incredible honour, glory and status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>All Authority</strong></td>
<td class="even">"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and
by him all things consist." <em>Colossians 1:16-17</em></td>
<td class="even">It's very hard for us to even imagine such a position of authority. But why is Jesus in such a position? The next verse gives us a clue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>For the Church</strong></td>
<td>"And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church," <em>Ephesians 1:22</em></td>
<td>
<p>Here we can see that Jesus have been given this position for the benefit of the church.</p>
But where is the church? Do they find themselves under the feet of the world or at the right hand of the Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Together with Christ</strong></td>
<td class="even">"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." <em>Ephesians 2:6-7</em></td>
<td class="even">The Father has given the church the same honour as Christ. We are <em>together</em> with Christ at the right hand of the Father. This shows us the incredible heart of God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Reason for Our Ineffectiveness</strong></td>
<td>The logical question then to ask is why the church finds itself in the position it is today. The Apostle Paul gives us the answer in <em>Ephesians 1:18</em>. It's because we do not understand the glory of our inheritance in Christ.</td>
<td>"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints," <em>Ephesians 1:18</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Journey</strong></td>
<td class="even">The only way for us to correct the situation is for us to ask God to show us more of His glory. We need to grow into this glory and appropriate it in our lives. We need to appropriate Christ's authority into our lives. We need to be born again.</td>
<td class="even">"Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." "</td>
