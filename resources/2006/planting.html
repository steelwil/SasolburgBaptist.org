<td><strong>It's a Process</strong></td>
<td>
<p>There is a process that takes place from the moment a seed is planted until you see the fruit. When God puts a word in our life, that's the seed being planted. But most of us want to see the fruit the very next day and we get disappointed when it
doesn't happen. We forget that there is a process involve. There's a journey to get to maturity before the fruit is ripe.</p>
<p>God spoke a word through Jeremiah and only about 70 years later during the reign of king Cyrus of Persia He brought it to fulfillment. Why do we think that it would be any different with us?</p>
</td>
<td>"In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia..."<em>Ezra 1:1</em>&nbsp;</td>

<td><strong>The Condition of the Heart</strong></td>
<td class="even">"So Eli told Samuel, 'Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.' ' So Samuel went and lay down in his place." <em>1 Samuel 3:9</em></td>
<td class="even"><p>The condition of the heart is important for one to be able to receive the seed. From this Scripture we see how Samuel had to learn to have a heart to receive.</p>
<p>What we need to do is to trust God to grow the seed.</p>

<td><strong>God At Work in You</strong></td>
<td>
<p>The Spirit is at work in us all the time and for this reason we need to be in step with the Spirit.</p>
<p>"for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose." <em>Philippians 2:13</em></p>
</td>
<td>It's therefore very important for us to set aside time for God outside of our normal prayer time. By dedicating time to meditate on Him allows God to work in us and grow the seed.</td>

<td><strong>Live By the Spirit</strong></td>
<td class="even">
<p>How do we live by the Spirit? By offering our bodies as living sacrifices and yielding to God.</p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>"So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature." <em>Galatians 5:16</em></p>

<td><strong>Discernment</strong></td>
<td>
<p>When we are in the Spirit, then we are able to discern what is from God and what is not.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>"Therefore, I urge you,...to offer your bodies as living sacrifices...Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good,
pleasing and perfect will." <em>Romans 12:1-2</em></p>
