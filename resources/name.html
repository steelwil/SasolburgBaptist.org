them in the midst of the land of Egypt. But I wrought for my name' sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt." <em>Ezekiel

<p>Satan will do whatever he can to distract us from our devotion to discredit the name of Jesus. He knows the power in the name of Jesus. He's hoping that when the world looks at us in our failure that they would say they don't want anything to do with
Jesus.</p>

which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel." <em>Exodus 19:5-6</em></td>
<td>From early on the purpose of Israel was to declare the glory of God the all the nations. The other nations' perception about God's reputation were going to be based on how God dealt with Israel and how Israel dealt with God.
