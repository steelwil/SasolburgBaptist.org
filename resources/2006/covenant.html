<td><strong>Not a Horizontal Agreement</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Man has his own opinion about marriage and very often sees it as an "horizontal" agreement. In other words, an agreement between two parties on earth. But a Christian marriage is more than just a horizontal agreement. It is a powerful mystery of Christ
in us and us in Christ. This is why there's such an attack on Christian marriages.</p>

<p><strong>The Third Strand</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken" <em>Ecclesiastes 4:11-12</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>There is a lot of opposition to relationships, partnerships and marriages. But Ecclesiastes 4:12 tells us that there need to be a "third strand" in order for the relationship to survive. God must be the third strand and this forms the "vertical" part
of the covenant.</p>
<p>Why do we need God to be the third strand? Because when things get tough, we need the power of God to keep us together.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>God Was There</strong></td>
<td>When we make marriage vows, we make it in the presence of man and God. In other words, God seals the covenant. For this reason we should call on the "third strand" when we go through difficult times in our marriage.</td>
