<p>"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. <b>My command</b> is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's <b>friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.</b> You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. This is my command: Love each other. John 15:9-17 (NIV)</p>

<p>The reality of being a friend of God.</p>

<p>"Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. In that day <b>you will ask in my name.</b> I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father."</p>

<p>Then Jesus' disciples said, <b>"Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.</b> Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God." John 16:25-30 (NIV)</p>

<p>Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. Ps 37:4 (NIV)</p>

<h3>TRANSFORMED THROUGH PROMOTION</h3>
<p>Several paradigm shifts take place in our hearts as we embrace this promotion.</p>

<p><b>First, <em>what we know</em> changes.</b> As we gain access to the heart of the Father. His heart is the greatest resource of information we need to function successfully in all of life. Jesus paid the price of our access to the Father, thereby granting us the freedom that comes from the truth we gain through that unlimited knowledge of His heart. Liberty is found in this phase of the promotion.</p>

<p><b>Second, our <em>experience</em> changes.</b> Encounters with God as an intimate are quite different from those of a servant. His heartbeat becomes our heartbeat as we celebrate the shift in our own desires. The realm of His presence becomes our greatest inheritance, and divine encounters our greatest memories. Personal transformation is the only possible result from these supernatural experiences.</p>

<p><b>Third, our <em>function</em> in life radically changes.</b> Instead of working for Him, we work with Him. We work not for His favour but from His favour. In this position He entrusts us with more of His power, and we are naturally changed into His likeness more and more. </p>

<p><b>Fourth, our <em>identity</em> is radically transformed.</b> Our identity sets the tone for all we do and become. Christians who live out of who they really are cannot be crippled by the opinions of others. They don't work to fit into other people's expectations, but burn with the realization of who the Father says they are. (Bill Johnson: Dreaming with God)</p>
