<h4>Representing the One Who Sent You</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Individually Called</strong></td>
<td>Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <em>is that</em> to thee? Follow thou me. <em>John 21:19-22</em></td>
<td>All of us have been individually and specifically called to follow Jesus. We can't look to this one or that one, but we have to personally take the responsibility to follow Jesus.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Not Our Ability</strong></td>
<td><p>And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. <em>1 Corinthians 2:4</em></p>
</td><td><p>This is why God is calling us to connect to the Holy Spirit, because our confidence is in the power of Jesus, in His ability and not our ability.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Whatever We Do</strong></td>
<td>And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, <em>do</em> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. <em>Colossians 3:17</em></td>
<td>This verse is connected to our calling, because we're going out in His name in everything we do. This is an awareness that we need to cultivate. It will change everything about our lives when we walk in this reality. Suddenly there will be purpose to everything we do.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>In His Name</strong></td>
<td>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. <em>John 5:43</em></td>
<td>Being sent by Jesus should give us that confidence of Jesus. But, how many of us are conscious of the reality that we have been sent by Jesus into the workplace, into the schools, into a church.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Honouring the One Who Sent You</strong></td>
<td>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me. <em>John 10:25</em></td>
<td>Coming in someone's name means that you have been sent by that person and that you represent that person. When we grasp this there will be a lot of things we will stop doing because it's not representing Jesus Christ.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Power in His Name</strong></td>
<td><p>And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? <em>Acts 4:7</em></p>
<p>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <em>even</em> in him doth this man stand here before you whole. <em>Acts 4:10</em></p>
<p>But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. <em>Acts 4:17</em></p>
</td><td>Things happen when we come in the name of Jesus. If we begin to walk in the reality that we have been sent by Jesus, we begin to see Jesus showing up.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>He Sent Us in His Name</strong></td>
<td><p>But the Comforter, <em>even</em>the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you. <em>John 14:26</em></p>

<p>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. <em>John 14:31</em></p></td>
<td>The Holy Spirit represents Jesus (John 14:26) sine the Holy Spirit was sent in His name. We also represent Jesus because Christ has also sent us into the world in His name (John 14:31).</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>The Presence of God in Every Situation</strong></td>
<td>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <em>Matthew 18:20</em></td>
<td>Walking in this reality brings in a new dimension of the presence of God in a situation.</td></tr>
