<h4>Can You Recognise It?</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>The Spirit Knows God </strong></td>
<td><p>When, however, the Spirit comes, who reveals the truth about God, he will lead you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of what he hears and will tell you of things to come.  </p>
<p>He will give me glory, because he will take what I say and tell it to you.   <em>John 16:13-14</em></p>
</td><td><p>It's important for us to know the character of the Holy Spirit, because it's the Holy Spirit that brings the voice and knowledge of God to us. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td><strong>He Gives Wisdom and Protection </strong></td>
<td><p>It is the LORD who gives wisdom; from him come knowledge and understanding. He provides help and protection for those who are righteous and honest. He protects those who treat others fairly, and guards those who are devoted to him.   <em>Proverbs 2:6-8</em></p>
</td><td><p>There's no earthly father with love in his heart that does not communicate to his children. How much more will our heavenly Father speak to us. He loves to share with us what's in His heart and mind through the Spirit. We therefore need to be open to receive what God wants to tell us. The Spirit of God gives us information so that we can be protected against the wickedness of the world. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Knowing God's Voice </strong>
</td><td><p>The gatekeeper opens the gate for him; the sheep hear his voice as he calls his own sheep by name, and he leads them out. When he has brought them out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.   <em>John 10:3-4</em></p>
</td><td><p>We have to know God in order to recognise His voice. The more you know the genuine, the more you'll know the counterfeit. It the same with the voices that we hear, the more we know God, the more we'll recognise His voice. As our relationship with God grows, the more we'll be able to discern His voice. We therefore cannot bypass intimacy with Christ if we want to hear his voice. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td><strong>The Character of the Voice </strong>
</td><td><p>But the wisdom from above is pure first of all; it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy.   <em>James 3:17</em></p>
</td><td><p>This is how we determine which voice we are listening to. Listening to God's voice will result in peace for the situation. When God speaks it will come with the character of God and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</p>
