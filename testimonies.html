According to <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Revelations+12%3A11">Revelations 12:11</a> we are to share our testimonies. That is what this page will be about. Sharing  to all around us.</p>

<p><em>2010-08-08:</em> I would just like to testify concerning the new job the Lord provided for me and bear witness to the power of prayer.  For a long time I was not very happy at work, although trying to serve the Lord, I found myself becoming very frustrated.  I took this situation to the Lord and he gave me a verse which basically stated that it is right for a person to be happy and fulfilled in their work.  This led me to apply for a different position at another organisation.  It was a job I personally thought would be ideal for me.  I asked every Christian I knew to pray about this and I was called for an interview.  Again I asked everyone to pray during my interview.  That very night after the interview, I was called and offered an even better job than the one I had applied for!  Many people prayed that I would find favour with the interviewers and I certainly did.  If there is a request to God you want to make, in line with His will, don't hesitate to ask as many people as possible to pray for your need.  God tells us in his word to present our requests to Him, and he loves us and wants to bless us.  Be encouraged by the fact that God answers prayer!</p>

<p><em>2010-04-25:</em> <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Ecc+4%3A12">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a> - A cord of 3 strands is not easily broken.<br />
Was really encouraged when standing in the Kitchen with a colleague, someone mentioned that they had flu. Colleague says “we can pray for you'. I would have been too cowardly on my own to suggest it. We did pray, right there and then! We are fast establishing a reputation at work as wierdos, but easier to be wierdos together than a lone wierdo!</p>

<p><em>2010-04-18:</em> A Believer was praying over a person for healing for a headache, another person witnessing this miracle was amazed that it had worked. This other person tried to pray over his own knuckles that had been sore for quite some time and was amazed when the pain was no longer there!</p>
<hr />

<p><em>2010-04-04:</em> A while back, I became fearful. In every situation I felt overwhelmed with fear. I started asking God why am I full of fear. I always considered trusting God and Faith easy for me. I Believed in the Bible and the power of the Holy Spirit. 
God answered me in a dream. He showed me “my seeds of faith” and then he showed me “maggots”. Eating up all my seeds of faith. I asked God where it came from. He showed me I was consuming my time on things of the world. I was concentrating on the worldly news more and more each day, pouring over articles and columnists writing about politics. I couldn't not stop reading. God showed me that I needed to be rather consumed by His word. “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness” <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Matthew+6%3A33">Matthew 6:33</a></p>

<p><em>2010-03-28:</em> One of our ladies has on two occasions prayed for workers in shops. One was complaining that she had a headache and the other that she was feeling fluey. And both times the people that were prayed for were so joyful when they were delivered from their aches and pains!</p>
