<h4>The Battle in the Mind</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Our Hospitality</strong></td>
<td>And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven. And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? <em>Matthew 9:2-5</em></td>
<td><p>When people come to visit us we go out of our way to make them feel special. We go out of our way to make them feel at home in our houses. We spend much of our time meeting their needs and giving them a place of honour because we want them to feel welcome in our homes.</p>
<p>We do the same with our thoughts. We entertain them, make them feel welcome, especially negative thoughts. But, in this scripture Jesus is saying that it's better to replace these negative thoughts with positive thoughts.</p></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>The Soil of the Mind</strong></td>
<td>Our minds are the most fertile soil for negative thoughts. When a little seed is planted we'll have a full-grown tree within a month.</td>
<td>We need to take these negative thoughts captive and to ask Jesus what He's saying about these thoughts. We need to begin to entertain Christ's thoughts. We are good at entertaining the bad, we need to get excellent at entertaining the good.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Negative Thoughts Cause Division</strong></td>
<td><p>The moment we have a negative thought towards anyone we become divided.</p>
<p>This is how the enemy gets into our homes and our relationships.</p>
</td><td>And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. <em>Matthew 12:25</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Mastering Our Thoughts</strong></td>
<td>Thou wilt keep <em>him</em> in perfect peace, <em>whose</em> mind <em>is</em> stayed <em>on thee</em>; because he trusteth in thee. <em>Isaiah 26:3</em></td>
<td>Our mind is kept steadfast by taking it to the cross and keeping it on Christ.</td></tr>
