<h4>Fear is a attitude of anxiety or distress caused by a concern over a threat to ones future.</h4>

<p><strong>The Consequence</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering. And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet
him, that he might salute him. And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at
Michmash;" <em>1 Samuel 13:9-11</em></td>
<td class="even">Saul's decision to offer up a sacrifice was made out of fear. The consequence of making this decision out of fear is devastating. God's plan for Saul was to have his kingdom last forever, but Saul became the last king in his family because of his
decision.</td>

<td><strong>Why We Fear</strong></td>
<td>"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice." <em>1 Samuel 15:24</em></td>
<td>
<p>Saul was given an instruction, but he disobeyed God our of fear. Very often we also make decisions out of fear. Sometimes we disobey God's instruction because of our fear of the implications of the instruction. The decisions we make when we're in God's
love is different to the decisions we make when we're full of fear.</p>
<p>The love of God should be the motivating factor for all our decisions and not fear.</p>

<p><strong>No Faith and No Love</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature." <em>Numbers 13:31-32</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Because of fear the Israelites wanted to choose a different leader than Moses to take them back to Egypt. The promise land was right there and they almost lost out on it because of fear.</p>
<p>Because of fear there is no faith and no love.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>God's Love Drives Out Fear</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love." <em>1 John 4:18</em></td>
<td>When we fear we know that we have removed ourselves from the reality of abiding in God's love. This is a check!<br />
We also see that God's love is more powerful than fear because it drives out fear. This is why God's love never fails.</td>
