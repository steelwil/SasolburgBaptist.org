<h4>Christ's Representation on Earth</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>"Seeing" the Kingdom of God</strong></td>
<td>Some Pharisees asked Jesus when the Kingdom of God would come. His answer was, "The Kingdom of God does not come in such a way as to be seen. No one will say, 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!'; because the Kingdom of God is within you." <em>Luke 17:20-21</em></td>
<td>We need to be born again in order to "see" the Kingdom of God.</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td><strong>Sent in His Name</strong></td>
<td>Jesus made a covenant to send the Holy Spirit to us. This was done in the context of Pentecost. The communion is therefore a reminder that Christ keeps his word. The Holy Spirit was also sent to present Jesus (the risen Christ) and to act on His behalf.</td>
<td>The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and make you remember all that I have told you. <em>John 14:26</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Confidence Through the Spirit</strong></td>
<td>It is clear that Christ himself wrote this letter and sent it by us. It is written, not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, and not on stone tablets but on human hearts. We say this because we have confidence in God through Christ. <em>2 Corinthians 2:3-4</em></td>
<td>We need to realise that we are the living temple of the Holy Spirit. There something about knowing that the Holy Spirit is in us that gives us an incredible comfort and confidence in this new covenant.</td></tr>
