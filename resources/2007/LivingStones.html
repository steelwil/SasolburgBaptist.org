<h4>Building God's Dream House</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr>
<td><strong>Living Sacrifices</strong></td>
<td>"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
<em>which is</em> your spiritual service." <em>Romans 12:1</em></td>
<td>How can we align ourselves to be in the center of the will of God? By offering ourselves as a living sacrifice.. However,
<strong>we</strong> have to offer ourselves. It's an act of will. The decision is therefore ours to make.</td></tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Jesus the Master Builder</strong></td>
<td>"ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <em>1 Peter 2:5</em></td>
<td>We are the living bricks of God's dream house. God is the chief architect and Jesus is the master builder.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Your Mindset Determines Your Future</strong></td>
<td>"And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, and ye may prove what is the
good and acceptable and perfect will of God." <em>Romans 12:2</em></td>
<td>It is Jesus who places us were He needs us to be. All we need to do is to trust in His ability to bring about His will for our
lives. Just like Joseph knew there was a bigger plan behind him being sold into slavery by his brothers (Genesis 45). In the same
way we need to keep our minds focused on God's will for our lives and not on the reality around us.</td></tr>
