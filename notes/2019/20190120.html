<p>The testimony of living loved by our Heavenly Father</p>

<h3>The Prayers</h3>

<p>"Holy Father, I am about to leave this world to return and be with you, but my disciples will remain here. So I ask that by the power of your name, protect each one that you have given me, and watch over them so that they will be united as one, even as we are one. Jn 17:11</p>

<p>For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. Eph 3:14-19</p>

<h3>Last Weeks Prayer</h3>

<p>For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Col 1:9-14</p>

<p>For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. 3 Now <b>this is eternal life</b>: that <b>they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent</b>... 8 For I gave them the words you gave me and they <b>accepted them</b>. They knew with <b>certainty</b> that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me. Jn 17:2,3,8</p>

<p>And the very words you gave to me to speak I have passed on to them.They have received your words and <em>carry them in their hearts</em><em>. (My Word abiding in them)</em>They are convinced that I have come from your presence,and they have fully believed that you sent me to represent you.</p>

<p>I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours. All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them. I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, <b>protect</b> them by the power (authority) of your name, the name you gave me, <b>so that they may be one as we are one...</b></p>

<p>"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray <b>also</b> for those who will believe in me through their message, that <b>all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. </b>Jn 17:9;11;20;21</p>

<h3>The promise and the happening: Holy Spirit and the New nature</h3>

<p>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. I will <b>give you a new heart </b>and <b>put a new spirit in you</b>; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put <b>my Spirit in you </b>and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.Ezekiel 36:25-27</p>

<p>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you <b>know him, for he lives with you and will be in you</b>. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. <b>On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you</b>. Jn 14:16-20 </p>

<h3>Reason and purpose of this prayer</h3>

<p>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. <b>The world cannot accept him</b>, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you <b>know him, for he lives with you and will be in you </b> Jn 14:16-</p>

<p>that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us <b>so that the world may believe </b>that you have sent me. Jn 17:21-</p>

<p>You live fully in me and now I live fully in them so that they will experience perfect unity, and <b>the world will be convinced </b>that you have sent me, <b>for they will see </b>that <b>you love </b>each one of them with the same passionate love that you have for me. V 23</p>

<h3>The Prayers</h3>

<p>"Holy Father, I am about to leave this world to return and be with you, but my disciples will remain here. So I ask that by the power of your name, <b>protect each one that you have given me, and watch over them so that they will be united as one, even as we are one. </b>Jn 17:11</p>

<p>For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And <b>I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God</b>. Eph 3:14-19</p>
