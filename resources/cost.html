<td><strong>Jesus' Obedience Cost Others</strong></td>
<td>"And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus." <em>Luke 23:26</em></td>
<td>This is one example of how Christ's obedience to His Father was costing others. Simon who was not part of the scene playing out up to this point was forced to get involved against his will. It cost him. What does our obedience to Christ cost
others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Even His Mother was Not Spared</strong></td>
<td class="even">"and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against; yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many
hearts may be revealed." <em>Luke 2:34-35</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Christ's love for His Father cost his mother. Iit was His mother who stood and watched as her son was beaten and killed on the cross. Jesus could have stopped it at any time to save his mother from going through that agony, but He stayed obedient to
His Father.</p>
<p>Our obedience to Christ will in a similar way sometimes cost our parents something. This is why Jesus said that we have to love Him more than our mother and father.</p>

<p><strong>Another Example</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support
them out of their own means." <em>Luke 8:2-3</em></td>
<td>Jesus' ministry even cost these women financially.</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Leave the Consequences to God</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"Stagnation in spiritual life comes when we say we will bear the whole thing ourselves" <em>Oswald Chambers</em></td>
<td class="even">One of the hardest things is to allow others to be part of the process and to come in to our lives and to bless our lives because of the cost to them. We should not feel sorry for people when they offer up something to help us. We have to allow God to
deal with the consequences.</td>
