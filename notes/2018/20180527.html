<h3>Living in the reality of being in Christ</h3>

<p>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing <em>in Christ</em>.  For He chose us <em>in him before the creation of the world</em> to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love  He  predestined us for adoption to sonship  through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will. Eph 1:3-5 </p>

<p>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.  Therefore, if anyone <em>is in Christ, that person is a new creation.</em>  The old has gone, the new is here!  All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ...  1Cor 5:16-18a</p>

<p>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your <em>life is now hidden with Christ in God.</em> When <em>Christ, who is your life</em>, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. Col 3:1-4</p>

<p>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms <em>in Christ Jesus.</em> Eph 2:6</p>
