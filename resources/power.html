<td><strong>Understanding the Power</strong></td>
<td>"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according
to the working of his mighty power," <em>Ephesians 1:18-19</em></td>
<td>This scripture asks that the eyes of our hearts be opened to understand the greatness of God's power.</td>

<td><strong>Mentioned Together</strong></td>
<td class="even">"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." <em>Acts 1:8</em></td>
<td class="even">When the power of God is mentioned, God the Spirit is involved.</td>

<td><strong>God's Power is Over Satan's Power</strong></td>
<td>"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him." <em>Acts 10:38</em></td>
<td>Again, here the Holy Spirit and the Power of God works together. This scripture also shows us that only the power of God can release people under the power of Satan</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Demonstrating the Power</strong></td>
<td class="even">"And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done." <em>Judges 14:6</em></td>
<td class="even">Here also we see that when the Holy Spirit is mentioned the power of God is involved. This is because the Holy Spirit demonstrates the power of God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Power and Spirit Overcoming the Grave</strong></td>
<td>"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:" <em>Romans 1:4</em></td>
<td>Nothing could keep Jesus in the grave. The power of God came into the body of Christ and raised Him from the dead.</td>
