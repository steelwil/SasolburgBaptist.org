<h4>The Battle is in The Mind</h4>

<td><strong>The Battle is for the Mind</strong></td>
<td>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. <em>Matthew
4:3</em></td>
<td><p>The greatest battle against faith is not the doubt we have, but our minds. It is our minds that cause us to doubt.</p>
<p>In this Scripture we see that Satan was trying to tackle the mind of Christ to cause Him to doubt.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Blinded Minds</strong>
</td>
<td>
<p>The mind of the unsaved person is blinded by Satan.</p>
</td>
<td>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
who is the image of God, should shine unto them. <em>2 Corinthians 4:4</em>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>A Well Used Ploy</strong></td>
<td>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath
God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? <em>Genesis 3:1</em></td>
<td>Here again we see how Satan were creating doubt in the mind by asking questions and making suggestions.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Jesus Gave the Solution</strong></td>
<td><p>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>
<p>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
<p>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of
sin. <em>Romans 7:23-25</em></p></td>
<td>Because of the cross our minds have to be rescued from the dominion of darkness.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Taking Your Thoughts Captive</strong></td>
<td>Through the power of God we are able to take every thought captive and make it obedient to God.</td>
<td>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down
imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to
the obedience of Christ; <em>2 Corinthians 12:4-5</em></td>
