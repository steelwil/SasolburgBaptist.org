<h3>1 Cor 2:6-16</h3>
<p><sub>6</sub> We do, however, speak a <b>message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age</b> or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. <sub>7</sub> No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. <sub>8</sub> None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. <sub>9</sub> However, as it is written:</p>

<p>"What no eye has seen,</p>

<p>what no ear has heard,</p>

<p>and what no human mind has conceived" —</p>

<p>the things God has prepared for those who love him—</p>

<p><sub>10</sub> these are the things <b>God has revealed to us by his Spirit.</b></p>

<p><b>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</b> <sub>11</sub> For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way <b>no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</b> <sub>12</sub> What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may <b>understand</b> what God has freely given us. <sub>13</sub> This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. <sub>14</sub> The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are <b>discerned only through the Spirit.</b> <sub>15</sub> The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, <sub>16</sub> for,</p>

<p>"Who has known the mind of the Lord</p>

<p>so as to instruct him?"</p>

<p>But we have the mind of Christ. 1 Cor 2:6-16 (NIV)</p>
