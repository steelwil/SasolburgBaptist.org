<h4>His Spirit Talking to Our Spirit</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Dedicated to the Father</strong></td>
<td>Dedicate them to yourself by means of the truth; your word is truth. <em>John 17:17</em></td>
<td>We have been dedicated to the Father to fulfil His call in our lives. The call of God might not be very specific at first, but it's very specific to us as individuals that we may hear God and know that He has something planned for our lives.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Spirit to Spirit</strong></td>
<td>The call of God is a supernatural phenomenon. It's the Holy Spirit speaking into our spirit man.</td>
<td>In some cases God may use a human vessel to bring the message to us, but it's the Spirit that talks to our spirit man.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>From Generic to Specific</strong></td>
<td>Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father sent me, so I send you." <em>John 20:21</em></td>
<td><p>We are sent into the world by Jesus to manifest his heart and kingdom to the world.</p><p>The call of God does not depend on our sanctification and we should stop making excuses that we're not worthy enough to do His work.</p></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Still Our Choice</strong></td>
<td>My commandment is this: love one another, just as I love you. <em>John 15:12</em></td>
<td>Here Jesus gives us His commandment, but we still have the choice to make.</td></tr>
