<h3>2. Kingdom Of God.</h3>

<p>Characteristics of Gods Kingdom:</p>

<p>The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of <em>righteousness, peace</em> and <em>joy</em> in the Holy Spirit.
Romans 14:17 (NIV)</p>

<p>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of <em>power</em>. 1 Cor. 4:20 (NIV)</p>

<ul>
<li>Righteous</li>
<li>Peace</li>
<li>Joy</li>
<li>Power</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Righteousness And Grace.</h3>

<p>The Rewards of Christ's Righteousness</p>

<p>"For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who <em>receive</em>
God's abundant provision of grace and of the <em>gift of righteousness reign in life</em> through the one man, Jesus Christ."
Rom 5:17 (NIV)</p>

<p>"So that, just as sin reigned in death, so also <em>grace</em> might <em>reign</em> through <em>righteousness</em> to bring
eternal life through Jesus Christ." Rom 5:21 (NIV)</p>

<ul>
<li>Grace reigns</li>
<li>Righteousness reigns</li>
<li>Life (Death being the separation from the life of God.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Experiencing Righteousness &amp; Grace Within An Unrighteous Environment.</h3>

<h4>Jesus is our example</h4>

<p>He the Righteous One lived among the unrighteous.</p>

<h4>Understand our new nature and get into agreement.</h4>

<p>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus" Rom 6:11</p>

<p>Romans 6: 1-12 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those
who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into
Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order
that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For
if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection
like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away
with, (Or <em>be rendered powerless</em>) that we should no longer be slaves to sin— because anyone who has died
has been set free from sin.</p>

<h4>Love is developed within an unrighteous environment.</h4>

<p>
<u>His divine power</u> has
<u>given</u> us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory
and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may
<u>participate in the divine nature</u>, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. For
this very reason, make every effort
<u>to add</u> to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control,
perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.
For if you possess these qualities in
<u>increasing</u> measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:3-8 (NIV)</p>

<h3>5. Power of God.</h3>

<li>Healing</li>
</ul>
