<h3>Kingdom of God: Family prayer strategy based on the book of Nehemiah.</h3>
<p>3 Levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal Family</li>
<li>Church Family</li>
<li>Community Family</li>
</ol>

<h3>Get God’s Vision / Heart</h3>
<p>"When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven". Neh
1:4</p>
<p>"Come up here, and I will show what must take place after this". Rev 4:1</p>

<h3>Understand whose authority it is under whom we operate (Spiritual Warfare)</h3>
<p>Then I prayed to the God of heaven, and I answered the king, If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favour in his
sight, let him send me to the city... Neh 2:4-5</p>
<p>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. James 4:7</p>

<h3>Total trust / confidence in God</h3>
<p>Neh 2:20 - "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding."</p>
<p>Eph 6:10 – "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power".</p>

<h3>Closed the door to the enemy</h3>
<p>"You have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historical right". Neh 2:20b</p>
<ul>
<li>No share</li>
<li>No legal right</li>
<li>No historical right</li>
</ul>

<p>Power of the death and resurrection of Christ - Redemption</p>

<h3>Select your builders</h3>
<p>Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate... Neh 3:1-32</p>
<p>Jesus said "I tell that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them". Matt 18:19</p>

<h3>Watch and Prayer : Overcoming Opposition</h3>
<p>From the beginning and right through the building of the walls and gates Nehemiah and the people faced opposition. Nehemiah
always responded firstly by praying. Neh 2-6</p>
<p>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
praying for all the saints. Eph 6:18</p>

<h3>Keeping To God’s Strategy</h3>
<p>Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families,
with their swords, spears and bows. Neh 4:13</p>

<h3>Encouragement</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters,
your wives and your homes. Neh 4:14</p>

<h3>Perseverance</h3>
<p>When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his
own work. Neh 4:15</p>
<p>... Being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience... Col
1:11</p>
