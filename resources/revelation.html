<td><strong>A Thankful Heart</strong></td>
<td>"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;" <em>Ephesians 1:15-16</em></td>
<td>
<p>A thankful heart is needed when we pray. It is difficult to pray for someone if there's criticism in out hearts.</p>
<p>If we can for a moment forget about ourselves and ask to Lord what His plan is for our company, our school, our community. We find our purpose when we find the answer to these questions.</p>
<p>There is also commitment to prayer. When ask God for something you must have persevere, it's not a once-off thing.</p>

<td><strong>Streams of Living Waters</strong></td>
<td class="even">"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. " <em>John 7:38</em></td>
<td class="even">When we pray, streams of living waters are being released from within. As we persevere in prayer the power of God is continually being released.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Kingdom Motive</strong></td>
<td>"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:" <em>Ephesians 1:17</em></td>
<td>The purpose of Paul's prayer was for the people to know Him better. The spirit of wisdom and knowledge is to know God FULL.</td>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Answer</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">"And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." <em>Matthew 16:17</em></td>
<td class="even">This is why Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:17 for the Lord to give the Spirit of revelation. Because with the spirit of revelation we have the answers to all of life's questions. When we know the will of the Father we will know what to do in every
situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Only Ask</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God." <em>1 Corinthians 2:10</em></td>
<td>
<p>Here we see that it is the Father through the Spirit that makes known His knowledge to man.</p>
<p>A large percentage of Christians have a veil over their hearts and minds. They don't have the revelation of the truth. They know the letter of the word, but they don't know the spirit of the word of God. The know the letter, but they don't know the
life.</p>
<p>The only reason we don't have revelation is because we don't ask the Lord to give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation. Part of our responsibility is to pray for this revelation for our community. Not only for the saved, but for the unsaved as
well.</p>
