<h4>The Realm in which Jesus Exercises Full Authority and Through which He Triumphs Over All Opposition</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Metamorphosis of the Body</strong></td>
<td>So then, my friends, because of God's great mercy to us I appeal to you: Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer. <em>Romans 12:1</em></td>
<td>We need to offer ourselves to God since the Holy Spirit lives in us. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit. This is why the Kingdom of God is within us.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Metamorphosis of the Mind</strong></td>
<td>Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God - what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect. <em>Romans 12:1</em></td>
<td>It's not only important for us to offer our bodies, but also our minds. Our thinking should no longer be conformed to the why the world thinks, but to the way God thinks.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Which Enemy are You Fighting?</strong></td>
<td>We need to ensure that we are fighting the right battle. The question we need to ask is what's opposing the reign of Christ in our lives? Paul said in Ephesians 6:12 that our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual realm. In the Book of Acts we saw how Jesus fought His battle in the spiritual realm and not in the natural realm.</td>
<td>You know about Jesus of Nazareth and how God poured out on him the Holy Spirit and power. He went everywhere, doing good and healing all who were under the power of the Devil, for God was with him. <em>Acts 10:38</em></td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Invincible</strong></td>
<td>But you belong to God, my children, and have defeated the false prophets, because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world. <em>1 John 4:4</em></td>
<td>Being a believer means that with the help of Spirit that dwells in us we can conquer anything the world might confront us with.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Kingdom on Earth</strong></td>
<td>May your Kingdom come; may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <em>Matthew 6:10</em></td>
<td>Jesus knew the importance of the Kingdom on earth. There is just an amazing change that takes place when we begin to pray with the understanding of the Kingdom within us.</td></tr>
