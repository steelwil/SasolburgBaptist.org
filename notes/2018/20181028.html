<p>Maturity : The Body of Christ to be the full expression of Jesus Christ</p>

<p>22 And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, <u>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.</u> Eph 1:22-23</p>

<p>May have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may <u>be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</u> Eph 3:19</p>

<p>For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. <u>And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.</u> (City of God here in 1947) Eph 2:19-22</p>

<p>"until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of <u>the fullness of Christ</u>, 14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. 15 Rather, speaking the truth in love, <u>we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,</u> 16 from whom the whole body, joined and held together <u>by every joint with which it is equipped</u>, when each part is working properly, makes <u>the body grow</u> so that it builds itself up in love".</p>

<p>Instead, speaking the truth in love, <u>we will grow to become</u> in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, <u>grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</u></p>

<p>16 For his "body" has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts <u>to contribute to the growth of all;</u> <u>and as these gifts operate effectively</u> throughout the whole body, we are <u>built up and made perfect in love</u>. Eph 4:13-16 ESV; NIV; TPT</p>

<p>Eph 4: 1 onwards</p>

<p>5 For the Lord God is one, and so are we, for we share in one faith, one baptism, and one Father. 6 <u>And He is the perfect Father who leads us all, works through us all, and lives in us all!</u></p>

<p>7 But to <u>each one</u> of us grace <u>has been given</u> as <u>Christ apportioned it</u></p>

<p>16 For his "body" has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept the grace gifts that Jesus has given to you / us</li>
<li>Connect the gifts to His purpose v10</li>
He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
<li>Get equipped v11-12</li>
11 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be <u>built up</u>. (Fullness of Christ)
<li>Take responsibility and start functioning with those gifts. v16</li>
From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
</ul>

<p>Maturity: We the Body of Christ continually grow in revealing more of Christ so that eventually the full expression of Jesus Christ is being expressed.</p>

<p>If we don't accept and operate in love with the gifts that Jesus has given to each one of us, then He is not being fully expressed.</p>

<p>It takes all of us to operate in love and minister the gifts for Jesus to be fully expressed here on this earth.</p>
