<td><strong>Our Motives</strong></td>
<td>"And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward. But thou, when thou
prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee." <em>Matthew 6:5-6</em></td>
<td>We should test our motives when we pray. When our motives are pure, God guarantees results by answering our prayers. This is how He brings honour to His name.</td>

<td><strong>Kingdom Principle</strong></td>
<td class="even">"For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." <em>Matthew
6:32-33</em></td>
<td class="even">The principle with kingdom prayers is to first seek God. This is a kingdom principle.</td>

<td><strong>Honouring God</strong></td>
<td>
<p>It's a good thing when we pray for others and ourselves, but it's a better thing when we pray for others and ourselves through the principle of God being honoured. The focus should be about God's honour and God's glory, not about us.</p>
</td>
<td>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son." <em>John 14:12-13</em></td>

<p><strong>Establishing the Kingdom on Earth</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">" Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth." <em>Matthew 6:10</em></td>
<td class="even">The purpose of Kingdom prayer is to see God's kingdom established here on earth. 
<p>Jesus' whole lifestyle was to bring glory and honour to His Father. Every miracle He performed was to glorify His Father and to establish the kingdom of God here on earth.</p>

<p><strong>Heaven is in Our Hearts</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>How do we establish the kingdom of God here on earth? By first establishing it in our own hearts.</p>
<p>The blessing of being born again is that we could have the kingdom of God in our hearts.</p>
<p>Our whole lifestyle will manifest the kingdom of God as we establish the kingdom of God in our hearts.</p>
</td>

<p>"And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you." <em>Matthew
17:20-21</em></p>
<p>"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." <em>Romans 14:17</em></p>
<p>"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power." <em>1 Corinthians 4:20</em></p>
