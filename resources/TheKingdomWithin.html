<h4>The Realm in which Jesus Exercises Full Authority and Through which He Triumphs Over All Opposition</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Jesus' Teaching</strong></td>
<td>This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven: May your holy name be honored; may your Kingdom come; may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. <em>Matthew</em> <em>6:9-10</em></td>
<td>One facet of the Kingdom of God is the reality of Christ in us. The King by His Spirit lives in us.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>What is the Kingdom?</strong></td>
<td>For God's Kingdom is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of the righteousness, peace, and joy which the Holy Spirit gives. <em>Romans 14:17</em></td>
<td>For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of words but of power. <em>1 Corinthians 4:20</em></td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>It's Inside of Us</strong></td>
<td>Some Pharisees asked Jesus when the Kingdom of God would come. His answer was, "The Kingdom of God does not come in such a way as to be seen. No one will say, 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!'; because the Kingdom of God is within you." <em>Luke 17:20-21</em></td>
<td>With this scripture Jesus made us aware of the sovereign move of the Spirit from within us. We therefore need to ask God that His sovereign rule within us be expressed in this world.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Living by Faith</strong></td>
<td>so that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. This life that I live now, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me. <em>Galatians 2:20</em></td>
<td>In order for Christ to live in us we need to die to ourselves and learn to live by faith and not on our own strength.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Victory From Within</strong></td>
<td>We so often live defeated lives because we're thinking like the world. Whenever we're faced with a difficult situation we need to remind ourselves of the Kingdom of God within us and that we've been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</td>
<td>But you belong to God, my children, and have defeated the false prophets, because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world. <em>1 John 4:4</em></td></tr>
