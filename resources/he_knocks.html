<td>"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." <em>Revelation 3:20</em></td>
<td>
<p>Here the Lord is not only speaking to the unbeliever, but to the believer as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's our responsibility to open the door and invite Him in to full occupation of every area of our lives. All we need do is to open the door and He promise to come and eat with us and us with him.</p>

<td class="even">
<p>Even the church can be in a place where it refuses to welcome Jesus in their midst. The church can keep Jesus outside of His people because their heart does not want to open up and welcome Him in. This is why the scripture in Revelation 3:20 ends with
the word churches.</p>
<p>However, as individuals we have no excuse since Jesus is speaking to us as individuals as well.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Always Knocking</strong></td>
<td>
<p>In Revelation 3:20 we see that Jesus stand at the door knocking. The text is in the present tense and shows Him taking the initiative to knock with a hope of getting a response.</p>
<p>It also shows the love of Christ of not giving up. Not even on this church who does not seem to be needing Him to which the original Scripture was directed (church in Laodicea).</p>

<p><strong>He's</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Not Stingy</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">Jesus is willing to share His glory with His people. His nature and generosity is the same even after going to the cross and rising up from the dead.</td>
<td class="even">"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." <em>Revelation 3:21</em></td>

<p><strong>His Door is Open</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter."</td>
<td>This is so powerful! Christ is knocking on our door waiting for us to invite Him in, but His door in heaven is standing wide open for us. This is how willing Jesus is to share His life with us that His door is not closed even though our door might be
closed.</td>
