<h3>The Church Declaration</h3>
<h4>The Church Believes</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments in their original writing as fully and verbally inspired of God and accept them as final authority for faith and life. (2 Tim 3:16)</li>
<li>In one God, eternally existing in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (Isa 9:6; 1 John 5:7; Matt 28:19; Zacc 13:7; 2 Cor 3:4; 2 Cor 3:17)</li>
<li>That Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Ghost born of the Virgin Mary, and is true God and true man. (Luke 1:35)</li>
<li>In the personality of the Holy Spirit, His regenerating work, and abiding presence in the true believer. (John 15:26; Titus 2:5; Rom 3:11)</li>
<li>That God created man in His own image; that man sinned and thereby incurred the penalty of death, physical, spiritual and eternal, that all human beings inherit a sinful nature which issues in actual transgression involving personal guilt. (Gen 1:26,27; Gen 2:17; Gen 3:6,19; Rom 5:12; Eph 2:1)</li>
<li>That the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins, a substitutionary sacrifice, according to the Scriptures, and that all who believe in Him are justified on the sole ground of His atoning work. (1 Cor 15:3,4; Eph 2:18; Rom 5:1)</li>
<li>In the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, His ascension into heaven, and His present life as our High Priest and Advocate before God the Father. (John 20:21; Acts 19; 1 Tim 2:5; 1 John 2:1; Hebrews 7:25-27)</li>
<li>In the personal, visible and bodily return of the Lord Jesus Christ to Earth. (Acts 1:11; John 14:3)</li>
<li>That all who receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become children of God (Eph 2:8,9; John 1:12,13)</li>
<li>That sanctification results in personal and practical holiness and is essential to a true and fruitful Christian life and service. (1 Thess 4:5; 1 Pet 2:1-9; 1 Pet 1:15,16; 2 Cor 7:1; 2 Cor 6:16; 1 John 1 &amp; 2)</li>
<li>In the resurrection both of the just and the unjust, the eternal blessedness of the redeemed and the eternal banishment and punishment of those who have rejected the offer of salvation through Christ. (Mark 9:43,44; John 3:18; John 5:28,29; Matt 25:34,41)</li>
<li>That the one true Church is the whole company of those who have been redeemed by Jesus Christ and regenerated by the Holy Spirit; that the local Church on earth should take its character from this conception of the Church spiritual, and therefore that the new birth and personal confession of Christ are essentials of Church membership. (Eph 4:4-6; Rom 12:5)</li>
<li>That Jesus Christ is the supreme head of the church and His authority is binding upon all Christians.</li>
<li>In the priesthood of all believers. (Eph 4:7-13; Rev 5:10; 1 Pet 2:9)</li>
<li>That the Lord Jesus Christ appointed two ordinances - Baptism and the Lord's Supper - to be observed as acts of obedience and as perpetual witnesses to the cardinal facts of the Christian faith; that Baptism is the total immersion of the believer in water as a confession of identification with Christ in burial and resurrection, and that the Lord's Supper is the partaking of bread and the Cup as symbolical of the Saviour's broken body and shed blood, in remembrance of His sacrificial death till He come, that salvation is not depended on the observance of the ordinances. (Rom 6: Mark 16:16; Luke 22:14-29)</li>
