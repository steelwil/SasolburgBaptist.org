<h3>Building the City of God with Jesus</h3>

<p>He "ascended" means that he returned to heaven, after he had first descended from the heights of heaven, even descending as far as the lowest parts of the earth. The same one who descended is also the one who ascended above the heights of heaven, in order to begin the restoration and fulfillment of all things. And he has appointed some <em>with grace</em> to be apostles, and some <em>with grace</em> to be prophets, and some <em>with grace</em> to be evangelists, and some <em>with grace</em> to be pastors, and some <em>with grace</em> to be teachers. <b>And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ. </b><em>These </em><em>grace ministries will </em><em>function </em>until we all attain oneness into the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one into a perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed into the abundance of Christ. Eph 4:9-13 TPT</p>

<p><b>HELPS Word-studies 2041</b> <em>érgon</em> (from <em>ergō</em>, "to work, accomplish") – a <em>work</em> or <em>worker</em> who accomplishes something. 2041 <em>/</em><em>érgon</em> ("work") is a deed (action) that carries out (completes) an <em>inner desire</em> (intension, purpose).</p>

<p><b>HELPS Word-studies Cognate: 1248</b> <em>diakonía</em> – <em>ministry</em>; active service, done with a willing (voluntary) attitude. See 1249 (<em>diakonos</em>).For the believer, 1248 <em>/</em><em>diakonía</em> ("ministry") specifically refers to Spirit-empowered service guided by faith (4102 <em>/</em><em>pístis</em>, "the Lord's inbirthed <em>persuasion</em>").[Observe the close connection of faith (4102 <em>/</em><em>pístis</em>) and 1248 (<em>diakonía</em>) in Ac 6:1-7,21:19,20; Ro 12:3,7; 1 Cor 16:13,15; Eph 4:12,13; 1 Tim 1:12,14; 2 Tim 4:5,7.]</p>

<p>The <b>Spirit gives life</b>; the flesh counts for nothing. The <b>words</b> I have <b>spoken</b> to you—they are <b>spirit and life </b>John 6:63</p>

<p>But if you live in <b>life-union with me and if my words live powerfully within you</b>—then you can ask whatever you desire and it will be done. When <b>your lives bear abundant fruit</b>, you demonstrate that you are my <b>mature disciples who glorify my Father!</b> John 15:7-8</p>

<p>We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the <b>wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives</b>, so that you may <b>live</b> a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: <b>bearing fruit in every good work</b>, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father... Col 1:9-12</p>

<p>We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. No, we declare God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. However, as it is written:"What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived" the things God has prepared for those who love him— these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, "Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?"But we have the mind of Christ. 1Cor 2:6-16 NIV</p>

<p>Every time we pray for you our hearts overflow with thanksgiving to Father God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For we have heard of your devoted lives of faith in Christ Jesus and your tender love toward all his holy believers. Your faith and love rise within you as <b>you access all the treasures of your inheritance stored up in the heavenly realm... </b></p>

<p><em>This is the wonderful message that</em> is being spread everywhere, <b>powerfully changing hearts throughout the earth, just like it has changed you</b>! Every believer of this good news bears the fruit of eternal life as they experience the reality of God's grace.</p>

<p>He's informed us of the <b>many wonderful ways love is being demonstrated through your lives by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.</b></p>

<p>Since we first heard about you, we've kept you always in our prayers that you would <b>receive the perfect knowledge of God's pleasure over your lives</b>, making you reservoirs of every kind of wisdom and spiritual understanding. We pray that you would walk in the ways of true righteousness, pleasing God in every good thing you do. <b>Then you'll become fruit-bearing branches, yielding to his life, and maturing in the rich experience of knowing God in his fullness</b>! And we pray that you would be energized with all his explosive power from the realm of his magnificent glory, filling you with great hope. Col 1:3-11 TPT</p>
