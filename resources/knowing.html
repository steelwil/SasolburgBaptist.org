<td><strong>Believing in Christ</strong></td>

<p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.&nbsp;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be
glorified in the Son.&nbsp;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it." <em>John 14:12-14</em></p>
</td>
<td>Here Jesus makes it very personal by saying to his disciples that the key to doing even greater miracles than Him is by believing in Him. There therefore is a promise for believing in Christ.</td>

<td><strong>The Truth vs. A Feeling</strong></td>
<td class="even">"And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
save us: we perish. And he saith unto them, 'Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?' Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm." <em>Matthew 8:23-26</em></td>
<td class="even">
<p>Very often we feel that God has forsaken us and that He's fast asleep in our storm. However, this is not the&nbsp;TRUTH, but only&nbsp;a&nbsp;FEELING.&nbsp;We feel that God abandoned us because we don't KNOW God. If we really knew God then we will be
enjoying the ride of the rough seas because we'll know that He's in the boat with us.</p>
<p>How many times in our past did God come through for us? When we're in the storms of our lives we need only to look at the memorial stones of what God has done in our past. We'll then&nbsp;begin to see and KNOW that He did not change.</p>

<td><strong>To Know</strong></td>
<td>"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, 'Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:&nbsp;As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou
hast given him.&nbsp;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.' " <em>John 17:1-3</em></td>
<td>Here Jesus is asking the&nbsp;Father that we may know Him.&nbsp;The truth is, that as we begin to know the Father, we also begin to know Jesus. And this is what Jesus' prayer is asking for.</td>

<tr>

<p><strong>A Hunger to Know</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>One of the Apostle Paul's ambitions was to know Jesus and we see this in 1 Cor 2:2 and Phil 3:7-12</p>
<p>We see in Eph 1:16-18 that Paul's desire was also for church to know Jesus.</p>
</td>
<td class="even">
<p>"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." <em>1 Corinthians 2:2</em><br /></p>
<p>"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: The eyes of your understanding being
enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints," <em>Ephesians 1:16-18</em></p>

<p><strong>Revelation Through the Father</strong></p>
</td>
<td>"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, 'Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?' And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He
saith unto them, 'But whom say ye that I am?' And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, 'Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
but my Father which is in heaven.'&nbsp;" <em>Matthew 16:12-17</em></td>
<td>It is the Father's will that we know Jesus. There's an inherent&nbsp;desire in our hearts to know Jesus Christ and the Father through His Spirit gives us the revelation of the Son.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Put the Plan to the Desire</strong></p>
</td>
<td class="even">Desire, however,&nbsp;is not a plan. There needs to be an action to the desire. As God puts the desire in our hearts to know Jesus, there is a plan of action that needs to come from our side. The desire in our hearts needs to lead to taking out time
to spend with Christ. Searching His Word and searching for Him.</td>
<td class="even">"The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing." <em>Psalms 10:10</em></td>
