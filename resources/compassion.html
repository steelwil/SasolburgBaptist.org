<td><strong>Spiritual Fruit</strong></td>
<td><p>One of the fruits of the Kingdom of God is compassion. This compassion should flow through us as we minister into the community.
This is what Christ did when He walked the earth.</p></td>
<td><p>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God." <em>2 Corinthians 1:3-4</em></p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Clothed with Compassion</strong></td>
<td><p>"Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;
forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also
do ye: and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness." <em>Colossians 3:12-14</em></p></td>
<td>Paul says that we should cloth ourselves with compassion. Clothing is not meant to be hidden, but to be seen. Similarly,
compassion is meant to be seen since compassion has an action. When we "wear" compassion the world therefore sees God.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Compassion Blocker</strong></td>
<td><p>"If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of
God.</p>

<p>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth." <em>Colossians 3:1-2</em></p></td>
<td>Our minds very often get in the way of us displaying compassion to people in need. This is why the Scripture says that we should
not only set our hearts on things above, but also our minds.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Compassion's Reward</strong></td>
<td>"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? When thou seest the
naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
rearward." <em>2 Isaiah 58:7-8</em></td>
<td>The glory of God is the manifested presence of God. This Scripture shows that when our hearts are open and we release the
compassion of God, then the presence of God follows.</td>
