<h3>Vision Sunday: Part 1</h3>
<p>Listen to the sermon:
<audio controls="" src="../../audio/2018/20180204.mp3">Listen</audio> (due to a technical issue only the first 12 minutes were recorded)
</p>

<h3>Reason &amp; Purpose</h3>

<p>From one man he made all the people of the world. Now they live all over the earth. He decided exactly <u>when</u> they
should live. He decided exactly <u>where</u> they should live. God did this so that people would seek him. Acts 17:26-27
(NIV)</p>

<p>What is the reason for being here? Why are we here?</p>

<p>What is the purpose for being here? What are we here for?</p>

<p>(Next Sunday: How do we ...?)</p>

<h3>Reason: God's love</h3>

<p>We are here because God loves.<br>
We are here because God loves this community.</p>

<p>John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son..."</p>

<p><b>God's love is the motivation, reason for giving His Son.</b></p>

<p>None of us would be here if it was not for God's love.</p>

<p><b><em>For Christ's love compels</em></b> us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.</p>

<p>Rom 5:5 "...Because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who He has given us".</p>

<p>We are born of God therefore have His nature in us. The NEW CREATION IN CHRIST.</p>

<p>
<b><em>NB: It is only from our new nature that we can identify and participate in the reason and purpose of God's love.</em></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual child of God - I am here because God loves...</li>
<li>Family - We are here because God loves...</li>
<li>Business - We are here because God loves...</li>
<li>Church - We are here because God loves...</li>
<li>Town - We are here because God loves...</li>
<li>Education/Government/Media / Arts &amp; Entertainment.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>When we connect to this we have the TRUE REASON for living.</em></p>

<h3>Purpose: To be called children of God</h3>
<p>God's love has a purpose:</p>

<p>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish
<u>but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world
through him.</u>
Jn 3:16-17 (NIV)</p>

<p>See what great love the Father has lavished on us,
<u>that we should be called children of God!</u> And that is what we are! 1 Jn 3:1 (NIV)</p>

<p>REASON: For
<u>Christ's love compels us</u>, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died...</p>

<p>PURPOSE: All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and
<u>gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting
people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</u>
We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf:
Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness
of God. 2 Cor 5:14-21 (NIV)</p>

<p>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and
love. 2 John:3 (NIV)</p>

<p>Grace: is pre-eminently used of the Lord's <em>favour</em> – freely <em>extended to give Himself</em> away to people (because He is
"always leaning toward them").</p>

<p>Grace is <u>unmerited favour</u>. It is God's free action for the benefit of His people.</p>

<p>Christ gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
<u>not counting people's sins against them.</u> And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 2 Cor
5:18 (NIV)</p>

<p>Ministering to the undeserved. Practical grace.</p>

<p>Our purpose is for this community 1947 to be reconciled to God and to be called Children of God.</p>

<p>Children – His nature being revealed through our lives.</p>

<br>Christ's love within gives reason and purpose.
<br>Lifestyle of love and the application of it's purpose</p>
