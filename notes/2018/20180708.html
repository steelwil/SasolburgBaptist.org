<p>13 Beloved ones, God has called us to live a life of <u>freedom in the Holy Spirit</u>. But don’t view this wonderful freedom as an opportunity to set up a base of operations in the natural realm. Freedom means that we become so completely free of self-indulgence that we become servants of one another, expressing love in all we do. 14 For love completes the laws of God. All of the law can be summarized in one grand statement: "Demonstrate love to your neighbour, even as you care for and love yourself." 15 But if you continue to criticize and come against each other over minor issues, you’re acting like wild beasts trying to destroy one another! Gal 5:13-15 TPT</p>

<p>16 As you yield freely and fully to the dynamic life and power of the Holy Spirit, you will abandon the cravings of your self-life. 17 For your self-life craves the things that offend the Holy Spirit <em>and hinder him from living free within you</em>! And the Holy Spirit’s intense cravings hinder your old self-life from dominating you! So then, the two incompatible and conflicting forces within you are your self-life of the flesh and the new creation life of the Spirit. 18 But when you are brought into the full freedom of the Spirit of grace, you will no longer be living under the domination of the law, <em>but soaring above it</em>! Gal 5:16-18 TPT</p>
