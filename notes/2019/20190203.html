<h3>Oneness that Jesus prayed about</h3>

<p>2 Peter 1:3-4 His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 4 Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</p>

<p><b>Gal 3:1-3</b> 1 What has happened to you Galatians to be acting so foolishly? You must have been under some evil spell! <b>Didn't God </b>open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus' crucifixion? Wasn't he revealed to you as the crucified one? 2 So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping all the Jewish laws? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah. 3 Your <b>new life </b>in the Anointed One <b>began with the Holy Spirit giving you a new birth</b>. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?</p>

<p><b>Gal 5:16</b> - As you yield freely and fully to the dynamic life and power of the Holy Spirit, you will abandon the cravings of your self-life. 17 For your self-life craves the things that offend the Holy Spirit <em>and hinder him from living free within you</em>! And the Holy Spirit's intense cravings hinder your old self-life from dominating you! So then, the two incompatible and conflicting forces within you are your self-life of the flesh and the new creation life of the Spirit. 18 But when you are brought into the full freedom of the Spirit of grace, you will no longer be living under the domination of the law, <em>but soaring above it</em>! 19 The cravings of the self-life are obvious: Sexual immorality, lustful thoughts, pornography, 20 chasing after things instead of God, manipulating others, hatred of those who get in your way, senseless arguments, resentment when others are favored, temper tantrums, angry quarrels, only thinking of yourself, being in love with your own opinions, 21 being envious of the blessings of others, murder, uncontrolled addictions, wild parties, and all other similar behavior.Haven't I already warned you that those who use their "freedom" for these things will not inherit the kingdom realm of God!</p>

<p>22-23 But the fruit produced by the Holy Spirit within you is divine love in all its varied expressions: joy <em>that overflows</em>, peace <em>that subdues</em>, patience <em>that endures</em>, kindness <em>in action</em>, a life full of virtue, faith <em>that prevails</em>, gentleness <em>of heart</em>, and strength <em>of spirit</em>. Never set the law above these qualities, for they are meant to be limitless. 24 Keep in mind that we who belong to Jesus, the Anointed One, have already experienced crucifixion. For everything connected with our self-life was put to death on the cross and crucified with Messiah. 25 We must live in the Holy Spirit and follow after him.</p>

<p><b>2Peter 1:3 </b>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you <b>may participate in the divine nature</b>, having <b>escaped the corruption </b>in the world caused by evil desires.</p>

<p>Eph 4:20-24 That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made <b>new in the attitude of your minds</b>; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.</p>

<p>By faith get into agreement with this. Renewed mind. Than the reality of ones spirit in union with God becomes ones norm.</p>
