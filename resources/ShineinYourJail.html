<h4>Staying True to Your Calling</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>Not Our Understanding</strong></td>
<td><p>Trust in the LORD with all your heart. Never rely on what you think you know.   <em>Proverbs 3:5</em></p>
</td><td><p>There are times when we do what is right and we end up in trouble. Like the story of Joseph where he resists the advances of Potiphar's wife and ends up in jail for doing the right thing. This is when we get confused and think that God had forsaken us. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td><strong>Not Giving Up</strong></td>
<td><p>The cup-bearer forgot about Joseph for two years after Joseph helped him in jail. However, Joseph kept on honouring God during this time. </p>
</td><td><p>But the wine steward never gave Joseph another thought-he forgot all about him.   <em>Genesis 40:23</em></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Honour Him in Your Jail</strong></td>
<td><p>We see that Joseph kept on honouring God even in jail.</p>
<p>No matter where we find ourselves, the call of God is still on our lives. We have to remember the Lord in times like these. </p>
</td><td><p>Remember the LORD in everything you do, and he will show you the right way.   <em>Proverbs 3:6</em></p>
</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td><strong>Acknowledging God</strong></td>
<td><p>The king said to him, "I have had a dream, and no one can explain it. I have been told that you can interpret dreams." Joseph answered, "I cannot, Your Majesty, but God will give a favorable interpretation."   <em>Genesis 41:15-16</em></p>
</td><td><p>Joseph still stayed committed to the Lord after years in prison and because of this God raised him up out of prison. </p>
<p>When we find ourselves in difficult times, we need to remember that God want to raise us out of our jail-experiences, but we have to acknowledge Him and not lean on our own understanding. </p>
