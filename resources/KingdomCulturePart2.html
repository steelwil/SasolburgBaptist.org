<h4>Culture: the totality of socially transmitted behaviour patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human works and thought characteristic of a community or population.</h4>

<table summary="sermon outline">
<tr><td><strong>From God's Kingdom</strong></td>
<td><p>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. <em>John 18:36</em></p></td>
<td>Out of God's kingdom He created the world and our solar system. However, our solar system is just a small part of our galaxy and there and many other galaxies out there.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>The Enormity of His Kingdom</strong></td>
<td>For in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him; <em>Colossians 1:16</em></td>
<td>Everything that was created, was created for Him. All the other galaxies out there were created for Him. It is then when we realise just how awesome and big God's kingdom is.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>We Are Not From Here</strong></td><td>But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <em>John 17:13-14</em></td>
<td>As we begin to take hold of Jesus we begin to take hold of the Kingdom culture. The world therefore looks at us and says that we are different.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td><strong>Born Again To Be Sanctified</strong></td>
<td>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God! That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <em>John 3:3-6</em></td>
<td>We were born into the kingdom of God when we gave our lives to Jesus Christ. We therefore do not belong to this world, but to the kingdom of God. And as we begin to take hold of the Spirit, the Spirit begins to show us how to live in truth. We are therefore set apart, sanctified.</td></tr>
